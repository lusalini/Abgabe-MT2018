INTRODUCTION 1 . The Third Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was held at the headquarters of the United Nations Environment Programme , in Nairobi , from 19 to 21 June 1991 .
I. OPENING OF THE MEETING
A. Opening remarks by the outgoing President of the Meeting of
the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances
that Deplete the Ozone Layer
2 . The outgoing President , Mr. David Trippier , welcomed the delegates to the Meeting , and said that it was a time of splendid achievement , marked by the advance from a 50 per cent cut in CFCs and a freeze on halons to the phasing out of both by the end of the Century , control of other substances , acknowledgement of the unique position of transitional substances , recognition of the real difficulties experienced by developing countries in complying with control measures and a greater emphasis on the importance of technology transfer in enabling developing countries to meet their obligations under the Protocol .
Not only had control measures been made more effective , but 17 countries had acceded to the Protocol since June 1990 .
There were few examples in the history of diplomacy where so many nations had agreed solidly to address a common concern .
3 . The London agreement had represented a great advance on Montreal and Helsinki , including in particular the very problematical development of a new funding mechanism .
Mr. Trippier said that great credit was due to the untiring efforts of the Executive Committee and its Chairman and ViceChairman , Ambassadors Ristimaki and Mateos for making the Interim Multilateral Fund a reality .
There was however still a long way to go .
Above all , he said , was the need to develop country studies as the bedrock for robust and implementable action on a country by country basis .
4 . Mr. Trippier observed that , at its Fourth Meeting this week , the Executive Committee had worked out framework agreements with the three Implementing Agencies UNEP , UNDP and the World Bank and agreed work programmes enabling those Agencies to carry out co-ordinated and wideranging operations for the rest of present year .
Now the Committee would need to look forward beyond 1992 into the future .
Na.91-6017 / ... 5 . It was important right from the start to be clear about the difference between &quot; hard technology &quot; , such as equipment and sophisticated operations and processes , and &quot; soft technology &quot; , including publications , personnel exchanges , education and training .
He was happy that the United Kingdom was playing an important role in the Technical and Economics Assessment Panel .
The strengthening of UNEP &apos;s Industry and Environment Office was another very welcome development .
Although there were many sources of funding for technology transfer , particular emphasis had to be placed on the most costeffective and efficient measures available , appropriate to the particular country &apos;s agreed phaseout programme .
6 . Mr. Trippier emphasized the importance of Parties ratifying the London Amendment , so that it could enter into force as planned on 1 January 1992 .
The next step was to make clear to the world the determination of the Parties to make noncompliance work and provide for an efficient implementation procedure .
7 . Further amendment of the Protocol was another very important issue , since new findings , for example satellite data , were becoming available all the time and it now appeared that ozone depletion over the globe as a whole was running at twice the anticipated level .
The European Community had already agreed to phase out CFCs by 1997 and hoped that other countries would do the same .
The Protocol should be amended to reflect that situation .
But that was not enough .
The Technology and Economics Assessment Panel should be asked to assess the implications of phasing out halons , carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform also by 1997 .
8 . It would again be necessary to look more closely at transitional substances and confirm that the guidelines set in 1990 were in fact adequate , since mistakes could delay the planned phaseout of CFCs .
The strategy of limiting the overall supply of ozone depleting substances had been successful beyond expectations and had encouraged industry to find different ways of cleaning , of blowing foam and of preserving food .
The same sort of mechanism should be applied to the transitional substances , since the markets and industrial structure were much the same and the environmental problem similar .
Since any phaseout date set in 1992 would be highly provisional and kept under constant review , it would be necessary to keep quantities down to acceptable levels right from the start .
9 . What had impressed him above all in his office as President had been the strength of the Montreal Protocol as a dynamic , ever changing instrument .
B. Election of the President , three VicePresidents
and the Rapporteur
10 . In accordance with Rule 21 , paragraph 1 of the Rules of Procedure , the President , three VicePresidents and the Rapporteur were elected unanimously , on the basis of regional groups , as specified in the resolution 2997 of the United Nations General Assembly at its 2112th meeting on 15 December 1972 :
President : Mr. Ojwang K &apos;Ombudo ( Kenya )
VicePresidents : Mr. Peter Chin Fah Kui ( Malaysia )
Mr. Ryszard Purski ( Poland )
Mr. Eduardo Lopez ( Venezuela )
Rapporteur : Mr. John A. Whitelaw ( Australia )
C. Statement by the President
11 . The President welcomed all the participants to Kenya and expressed his gratitude for the honour bestowed upon him by his election .
The work of the bodies created to implement the Montreal Protocol had lived up to expectations .
He also paid tribute to the work of the Executive Director of UNEP , the Secretariat for the Vienna Convention and its Montreal Protocol and the outgoing President , Mr. David Trippier , Minister of the Environment of the United Kingdom .
He hoped that the spirit of cooperation shown so far would continue to prevail as the work of the Parties was now at a crucial stage .
The world community was eager for action on protection of the ozone layer , and he was sure that the Parties would not be found wanting in that respect .
D. Statement by the Executive Director of UNEP
12 . In his statement , the Executive Director paid tribute to the effort of the outgoing President , his predecessor and the Bureau , which had left a lasting mark on international relations , and wished the new President and Bureau every success in their tasks ahead .
The countries that had joined the Protocol since the London Meeting , including 13 developing countries , took the total of Contracting Parties to 71 .
The Interim Multilateral Fund had been established and had become operational on 1 January 1991 as decided by the Parties .
The Chief Officer of the Fund had assumed his function in February and the Executive Committee had already worked hard to build a solid foundation for an unprecedented financial mechanism .
The implementing agencies ( UNDP , the World Bank and UNEP ) had agreed co-ordinated programmes which had been examined by the Executive Committee over the past few days .
He introduced the new Co-ordinator of the Secretariat for the Vienna Convention and its Montreal Protocol , Mr. Sarma .
13 . The Executive Director stressed that statesmanship of a high order would be needed in the future , as recent research by NASA and the WMO Global Ozone Observing System has established that depletion of the ozone layer was accelerating at a higher level than predicted and was spreading to non-polar regions .
Even with an immediate phase-out of all CFCs and related components , ozone destruction would increase well into the next century .
14 . Therefore the Executive Director stressed the importance of the London Amendment , which had been ratified so far by two Parties only .
He urged Governments to speed up the process of ratification to ensure entry into force of the Amendment by 1 January 1992 , noting that the USSR had signalled its ratification and that Sweden had agreed on 4 June 1991 to ratify .
Several other Governments were in the process of ratification and China had acceded to the Protocol as amended in London .
China would need technical and financial support to move to implementation of the Protocol .
15 . The Executive Director also addressed the difficulties encountered by the Fund because of delayed contributions ; US $ 12.7 million had been received so far .
He reminded the Parties that even if financial resources were available to developing countries , there was still the question of availability of technologies .
Industry should be encouraged to make still further and faster progress in developing replacement chemicals and technologies so that all countries could be assisted to find solutions to their problems and those that had not yet done so could become Parties to the Montreal Protocol .
One of the success stories in the struggle to protect the ozone layer concerned Mexico , which was phasing out CFCs aerosols faster than some developed nations .
There was a need to replicate such successes .
16 . Another pressing need addressed by the Executive Director was the monitoring of non-compliance and the reaction of the Parties to delayed reporting of data .
Guidance from the meeting would be helpful for the finalizing of the study of non-compliance procedures .
Other matters for the meeting to consider included the responsibilities of countries operating on the basis of Article 5 which exceeded a consumption level of 0.3 kg per capita per annum ; the application by one country from the Western European and other group to be considered as a developing country for the purpose of the protocol ; and a number of trade issues .
17 . Extraordinary progress had been made under the Montreal Protocol thanks to public opinion , a real spirit of partnership established between the Parties , and the work of the Assessment Panels .
The second report from the Assessment Panels , to be completed before the end of 1991 , together with other issues , might signal the need for the further amendment of the Protocol .
18 . Finally , the Executive Director recommended that the next Meeting be held in September 1992 , to allow the Open-Ended Working Group of the Parties to consider any adjustments and amendments necessitated by the report of the second assessment .
He expressed his conviction that although there were still many difficulties to be overcome , the spirit of co-operation and the progress achieved so far were such that the damage done to the planet could be corrected .

22 . In accordance with rule 19 of the Rules of Procedure , the officers of the Meeting examined the credentials of representatives and , having found them to be in good and due form , so reported to the Meeting .
IV . SUBSTANTIVE MATTERS
23 . The Preparatory Meeting had proposed that Rules 23 and 24 of the Rules of Procedure of the Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol be amended to read as follows :
Rule 23
If the President is temporarily absent from a session or any part thereof , he shall designate a VicePresident to act as President .
Rule 24
If an officer resigns or is otherwise unable to complete his term of office or to perform his functions , a representative of the same Party shall be named by the Party concerned to replace him for the remainder of his mandate .
The proposed amendments were adopted without objection .
24 . The delegate of China said that the gradual reduction in the volume of ozone depleting substances was a vital element in the protection of the environment .
Only combined efforts of Contracting Parties and developing countries at the Second Meeting of the Parties , in which China had played an active part , had enabled the Amendment to the Protocol to be adopted , thus tightening up control measures and providing financial support for activities of developing countries in the cause of environmental protection .
Against that background the delegation had expressed at the Second Meeting the clear intention of his country to accede to the Amended Protocol .
In the meantime the necessary technical structures had been set up and the legal formalities for accession completed .
The Instrument of Accession had been deposited with the United Nations as Depositary on 14 June 1991 .
A year ago , with the help of an Expert Working Group from UNDP , China had completed a study on the phaseout of controlled substances and formulated a threeyear plan for the first phase of implementation of the phaseout .
25 . Many delegations welcomed the statement and congratulated China on its accession to the Montreal Protocol and recalled China &apos;s valuable input into discussion of the proposed financial measures of the Second Meeting .
Several also observed that early discussion of a country programme with China would be necessary and the total sum of the Multilateral Fund increased accordingly .
One Delegation announced an immediate increase in its contribution to the Multilateral Fund to US $ 2m and looked forward to the time when it would be possible to tear up those parts of the Protocol which dealt with nonParties .
Many delegations expressed wishes to expand co-operation with China and referred in this connection to their on-going and planned activities .
There was general agreement that China &apos;s accession to the Montreal Protocol was an essential step in the process of implementing the Montreal Protocol .
26 . The delegation of the Republic of Korea said that its Government , concerned by the level of environmental contamination , had already imposed strict measures to protect the ozone layer by legislative measures and institutional restructuring , but felt bound to draw attention to the very adverse effects which such measures were likely to have on young industrial countries .
In view of the extent of investment in CFC manufacture , any drastic reduction in output could result in serious unemployment and social unrest .
Nevertheless legislation had been passed and would be implemented .
It was hoped that this cooperative attitude would be met by a voluntary transfer of technology and appropriate financial resources .
Success would only be possible if developing and developed countries worked together .
27 . The delegate of Malaysia said that , when his country became Party to the Protocol in November 1989 , parallel action had been taken to introduce Customs Control regulations to monitor CFC and halon imports , but unfortunately that had given rise to technical difficulties and countries with developing economies required time to adjust to the provisions of the protocol .
It was during the interim period that noncompliance tended to occur .
Malaysia , as a country operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , had already initiated processes for the elimination of CFCs and halons from the aerosol , solvent , cleaning , refrigeration , air conditioning , fire protection , foam manufacturing and other sectors .
The Implementation Committee was a very important organ .
Malaysia further suggested that its efficiency could be greatly improved by an equitable distribution of the membership between developed and developing countries .
The delegate of Malaysia said that the establishment of the Multilateral Fund as a new and additional financial resource was precedent-setting and it could well be a future model .
Malaysia , as a member of the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund , had made a positive and constructive contribution to the work of the Committee and faithfully represented the views of other developing countries in the Asian region .
28 . One delegation pointed out that the Amendment to the Protocol , made at the time of the Second Meeting , was an important contribution to environmental protection , but had been overtaken by some recent scientific findings , which necessitated more stringent regulations .
Phaseout could of course only be achieved by a transfer of technology to the developing countries .
This delegation among others was sponsoring a draft resolution , stressing the urgency of the situation , and hoped that other delegations would rally to its support .
The country &apos;s national plan provided for phaseout of all currently controlled substances to be complete well before 1997 .
Another most important issue was the need to provide Assessment Panels with their terms of reference well in advance , to enable them to organize their work .
29 . A nongovernmental organization reported on the establishment and implementation of control measures in one area of a country in accordance with Article 2 of the Protocol , which had been revised and updated after the Second Meeting of the Parties .
This had resulted in a 30 per cent reduction in total consumption of controlled substances in 1990 in the area , corresponding to 70 per cent of the 1986 level .
The organization stated that this represented a major effort in the spirit of the Montreal Protocol and wished to contribute both technically and financially to the global efforts to protect the ozone layer .
30 . The Chairman of the Scientific Assessment Panel , Dr. R.T. Watson , said that assessments of scientific and environmental impacts and a technology / economic assessment had been initiated that would provide the scientific and technical information required as a basis for possible amendments to the amended Montreal Protocol to be considered by the Parties at their Fourth Meeting in 1992 .
The scientific assessment would include a discussion of : trends in ozone and other chemical constituents both globally and regionally ; comparison of observed and calculated ozone trends ; prediction of atmospheric chlorine loading , ozone depletion and the contribution to global warming for a number of scenarios concerning CFCs , HCFCs , HFCs and the space shuttle , and a revised table of ozone depleting and global warming potentials .
The environmental impacts assessed would cover human health ( skin cancer , eye cataracts and suppression of the immune system ) , terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems , material damage and tropospheric oxidants .
The technology / economic assessment would review the technical and economic aspects of substitution of CFCs for refrigerants , foam blowing agents , solvents and aerosol propellants , and halons .
The synthesis document would be completed , translated in all languages and sent to the printers by 1 December 1991 .
The latest satellite and groundbased ozone data demonstrated that the rate of ozone depletion at mid and high latitudes in both hemispheres was greater than previously measured .
In addition , current gasphase photochemical models underestimated by factors of 25 the observed ozone loss .
While the cause of the observed ozone depletion had not been unequivocally identified , the ozone changes coupled with other atmospheric data were strongly suggestive of a chlorineinduced effect .
The new scientific data , coupled with simple model calculations of atmospheric chlorine loading , suggested that the following measures would be required in order to minimize the projected peak chlorine loading , ozone depletion , elimination of the Antarctic Ozone hole and the observed midlatitude ozone loss : a reduction in the emissions of longlived CFCs , CCL4 , CH3CCL3 and halons , as soon as possible , with global compliance ; transitional substitution for longlived CFCs with HCFCs having the shortest possible lifetimes , hence low ODP values ; the recycling of HCFCs to the maximum extent possible , the notinkind substitution of CFCs wherever practical ; phaseout of HCFCs sometime during the next century ( phaseout date should depend upon the atmospheric lifetime of the substitute ) ; and possible emission rate limitations .
Parties should recognize that HCFCs were not all equal ; those with short lifetimes , i.e. , 15 years , posed a significantly lower threat to the ozone layer and global warming than those with moderate lifetimes , i.e. , greater than 15 years .
31 . Since one delegation objected to the inclusion of parts of above paragraph 30 , it was agreed that the text should be referred to the Chairman of the Scientific Assessment Panel for review and any necessary revision .
32 . The Chairman of the Implementation Committee , Ms. Bjorklund , recalled that the Committee had been established to respond quickly to early indications of noncompliance , with the aim of resolving problems amicably and obviating the need for recourse to formal arbitration or the International Court of Justice .
This was a new way of solving such conflicts and , if successful , would set a precedent in the environmental field .
However , as the Brundtland Commission had stressed , all aspects relating to agreements and mechanisms for dealing with noncompliance needed to be precisely defined .
At its meeting in December 1990 and April 1991 , the Implementation Committee had studied the draft noncompliance procedures developed by the Ad Hoc Working Group of Legal Experts and had called for central clarifications and for consideration of new elements for inclusion as outlined in the Committee reports ( documents UNEP / OzL.Pro / Imp.Com.1 / 2 and 2 / 3 ) .
A number of these issues were reflected in draft Decision III / 2 to be considered by the Parties , but further guidance from the Parties would be useful .
The Implementation Committee had also examined the data reported in accordance with Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol and concluded that reporting was not satisfactory : of 71 Parties , only 31 had reported complete data for 1986 .
Of the remainder , 19 had reported incomplete data , 6 had reported no data available and / or requested assistance , 2 had reported that their data were included in those of another Party and 13 had not reported data .
Of 48 Parties required to report data for 1989 , only 23 had complied by May 1991 , and only 20 of these had submitted complete data .
Some developing countries were experiencing serious reporting problems owing to lack of technical and economic resources .
She noted that the Ad Hoc Working Group of Legal Experts had suggested several ways of solving these problems , including the establishment of import control by customs regulations based on a harmonized commodity system .
The Implementation Committee had stressed the need for technical and financial support to countries to enable them to comply with the provisions of the Montreal Protocol with regard to data reporting and felt that the Multilateral Fund was of assistance in this regard .
Establishing noncompliance when the only resource was the lack of such support would only hurt the developing countries .
33 . Discussing the draft decisions recommended for adoption by the Preparatory Meeting , draft Decision III / 2 ( Noncompliance procedure ) , as amended , was adopted .
34 . In regard to draft Decision III / 3 ( Implementation Committee ) , two delegations felt that it was important to clarify that the noncompliance procedure should be without prejudice to the operation of the settlement of disputes procedure laid down in Article 11 of the Vienna Convention .
Draft Decision III / 3 , as amended , was adopted .
35 . It was suggested that the Montreal Protocol Handbook ( draft Decision III / 4 ) might with advantage be made available for sale , and also that it could be issued in a computerreadable version .
The draft decision was adopted .
36 . Draft Decision III / 8 ( Trade names for Controlled Substances ) was adopted with the amendments recommended by the Bureau .
It was recommended that when the list of trade names had been finalized , it should be annexed , for reference , to the instruction sheet for the formats for reporting of data .
37 . Draft Decision III / 10 ( Destruction Technologies ) was adopted with the amendments proposed by the Bureau .
One delegation drew attention to the large body of expertise available and recommended the participation of other experts , perhaps in the capacity of observers .
38 . During discussion of draft Decision III / 13 ( further adjustments to and amendments of the Protocol ) it was agreed that the OpenEnded Working Group should be requested to submit a report on the proposals to the Fourth Meeting of the Parties .
Some delegates requested clarification in regard to the position of a country operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 which exceeded the 0.3 kg ceiling for controlled substances , in particular whether that would lead to its disqualification .
Many delegations believed that the Protocol was clear on that point .
In view of the serious consequences to the Party concerned , the matter was referred to the OpenEnded Working Group of the Parties for examination and any recommendations that might be necessary .
Draft Decision III / 13 , as amended was adopted .
39 . The Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Interim Multilateral Ozone Fund of the Montreal Protocol , Mr. Ilkka Ristimaki , introduced the draft report of the Fourth Meeting of the Executive Committee ( UNEP / OzL.Pro. / ExCom / 4 / 12 ) and informed the meeting of a number of amendments that should be reflected in the report .
40 . The Chairman summarized the actions and decisions taken by the Executive Committee with regard to the operation of the Interim Multilateral Ozone Fund during the first year .
The legal basis and the financial regulations were drawn up in good time to enable the Fund to become effective from 1 January 1991 , with Montreal as the venue of its Secretariat .
Mr. Omar ElArini , appointed as Chief Officer , assumed his functions in February 1991 and all staff would have been recruited by the end of 1991 .
The Executive Committee had held four meetings , the first in September 1990 .
He expressed the Committee &apos;s gratitude to UNEP and the Canadian authorities for interim Secretariat services .
A revised version of the threeyear budget would need to be prepared and presented to the Parties in the light of the decision of China to accede to the Protocol .
42 . The Committee had developed and adopted &quot; Implementation Guidelines and Criteria for Project Selection &quot; ( document UNEP / OzL.Pro. / ExCom / 3 / 18 , Annex III ) . Each Party was invited to draw up a country programme to serve as a basis for project operation and financing from the Fund .
43 . Tripartite interagency agreements had been signed between UNEP , UNDP and the World Bank and individual agreements between these agencies and the Executive Committee were ready for signing .
At its fourth meeting the Executive Committee approved work programmes by the three agencies for 1991 .
The total amounts approved to the agencies as of 18 June 1991 : UNEP US $ 1,676,920 ; UNDP US $ 1,261,800 ; World Bank US $ 5,000,000 , yielding a total of US $ 7,938,720 .
44 . At its next meeting the Executive Committee would consider country programmes , separate projects submitted by Parties , possible additional proposals by the implementing agencies for the 1991 work programmes , and proposals for the agencies work programmes for 1992 and 1993 .
45 . The Chairman referred to the terms of reference of the Executive Committee which stated that the office of chairman was to rotate on an annual basis between the Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 and the Parties not so operating .
For the annual rotation to take place the two groups of countries should be invited to select the Chairman and the ViceChairman accordingly and present their selection to the Parties for endorsement .
46 . Referring to the need to revise the scale of contributions , the Assistant Executive Director proposed that the total amount of contributions for 1991 agreed by the Second Meeting of the Parties should remain unchanged but that the total amount of contributions in 1992 and 1993 be increased by US $ 20 million each year , raising the threeyear total from US $ 160 million to US $ 200 million .
In accordance with the United Nations regular budget scale of assessment , the percentage contributions of new states will be : Bulgaria 0.15 , Czechoslovakia 0.66 and Poland 0.56 .
The revised percentage contribution for unified Germany would be 9.36 .
The contributions for 1992 and 1993 would be recalculated accordingly .
One delegation emphasized the need to take into consideration the difficulties being experienced by countries undergoing economic transition , particularly in Eastern and Central Europe .
47 . A number of delegations paid tribute to the work of the Executive Committee and of its Chairman and Vice-Chairman and welcomed the progress made .
One delegation noted the need to develop quickly strategies for funding country programmes which would maximize available resources .
One delegation clarified that its inkind contributions to the Multilateral Fund would include transfer of technology , provision of expertise and training .
Another delegation expressed the hope that strategies could be developed and put into effect quickly so that money earmarked for bilateral and regional projects could be utilized .
48 . The representative of the World Bank welcomed the progress made by the Executive Committee .
Preparatory work in countries not party to the Protocol had placed the World Bank in a position to respond quickly when those countries joined , as was the case with China .
A number of studies had identified suitable investment programmes but commitments could not be made unless funds were available .
He therefore emphasized the need for timely contributions .
He drew attention to the possibility of assisting countries not covered by the Multilateral Fund through the Global Environment Facility .
49 . After some discussion , including the approval of certain amendments to the Rules of Procedure for meetings of the Executive Committee , the Meeting endorsed the Rules of Procedure as contained in Annex VI of this report , and adopted decisions concerning the Interim Multilateral Ozone Fund ( Decision III / 22 ) .
The revised 1991 budget for the Fund Secretariat was adopted as contained in Annex VII to this report .
The three-year plan and budget for the Fund Secretariat and the three-year budget for Fund Operations are contained in Annexes VIII and IX , respectively . The revised scale of contributions was adopted as contained in Annex X.
50 . The Assistant Executive Director introduced the revised budgets for 1991 , and proposed budgets for 1992 and 1993 for the Trust Fund for the Montreal Protocol prepared after consultation with the subgroup set up by the Preparatory Meeting to consider the matter in detail .
Although a number of changes had been made in individual budget lines , the overall total of the 1991 budget showed no change from that adopted by the Second Meeting of the Parties and no additional contributions from Parties would be necessary .
He emphasized that the proposed budgets would only be viable if all Parties paid their contributions as far as possible early in the year .
The Parties noted the status of contributions in 1990 and 1991 as contained in Annex III and the 1990 expenditures as contained in Annex IV to this report .
The Parties adopted a decision on budgets and financial matters ( Decision III / 21 ) .
The revised 1991 budget and the 1992 and 1993 budgets adopted by the Parties are contained in Annex I to this report and the adopted list of contributions to be made by the Parties is contained in Annex II of this report .
51 . During discussion on the proposed annex to the Montreal Protocol containing a list of products containing controlled substances , one delegation expressed doubt regarding the desirability of including portable fire extinguishers .
Another delegation said that their inclusion was necessary in terms of Article 4 , paragraph 3 .
One delegation raised the possibility of including transportation refrigeration units .
It was pointed out that the subgroup set up by the Preparatory Meeting had considered that issue but had recommended that they should not be included in view of the implications for trade in refrigerated goods , especially foodstuffs .
Two delegations felt that to do so would impinge on sensitive areas covered by GATT .
One delegation requested that the legal position with regard to GATT be clarified .
One delegation stated its understanding from Article 4 , paragraphs 3 and 3 bis , that nonParties had the right , at the time of joining , to object to the annex .
The list was adopted , with the title amended to ensure that it was unambiguous ( Decision III / 15 ) .
The Parties adopted the list as contained in Annex V of this report .
The Secretariat agreed to identify the relevant Brussels nomenclature numbers as well as those of the Harmonized Commodity Systems .
It was pointed out that the products listed in Annex D could also be manufactured without containing controlled substances .
The Parties emphasized that the products listed in Annex D are only those that contain controlled substances .
52 . During the discussion on agenda item 8 , one delegation stated that the data reported for his country in accordance with Article 7 had not been authorized by the Government but had been provided on an unauthorized basis .
Now that the country was a Party to the Montreal Protocol , it would be in a better position to collect official data .
In discussions regarding its country programme , it had been agreed with the World Bank that clarification of the data would be sought during implementation of the programme , due to start in September 1991 .
He hoped that the matter could be clarified prior to the Fourth Meeting of the Parties .
The Meeting was informed that the Secretariat would obtain further information from this country .
53 . After discussion of a draft decision on assessment panels , an amended text was adopted ( Decision III / 12 ) .
Some delegations stated that their countries , in view of their current economic and financial situation , would be unable to adapt to a more stringent timetable for ozone depleting substances control than that set out by the Second Meeting of the Parties or to comply with the obligation to include various transitional substances in the list of controlled substances .
54 . After considering draft Decision III / 20 ( Composition of the Implementation Committee ) , it was decided to retain the present geographical distribution of members of the Implementation Committee , but to increase the number to ten .
It was also decided to delete the last sentence of paragraph 3 of Annex III ( Noncompliance procedure ) contained in document UNEP / OzL.Pro.2 / 3 ( Report of the Second Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol ) and to amend the word five to ten in line 2 of the paragraph .
One delegation proposed a consequent amendment to subparagraph ( e ) of Decision III / 3 ( Implementation Committee ) , confirming the present five members of the Implementation Committee in office for a further year and calling on the geographical groups to nominate five further members for election to the Committee for a period of 2 years . Decision III / 3 ( e ) was adopted after the election of the five further members .
Parties should take account of legal and technical expertise when nominating members .
The amendment to Annex III of document UNEP / OzL.Pro.2 / 3 was adopted .
55 . During consideration of the accession of Turkey to the Montreal Protocol , the Secretariat introduced the Executive Director &apos;s explanatory note on the list of developing countries .
On a point of order , one delegation objected to consideration of the issue , since the Secretariat had not reported on the administrative and financial implications in accordance with Rule 14 of the Rules of Procedure .
The same delegation mentioned that the note in question was no more than background information addressed to the Bureau of the Second Meeting of the Parties and in no way complied with provisions of Rule 14 .
The delegation proposed that , as there were serious implications , consideration be deferred until the Fourth Meeting of the Parties .
The Secretariat explained that the actual implications had been pointed out in the note and that it had complied with Rule 14 .
Some delegations commented that the item had been included in the agenda circulated well before the Meeting and adopted by the Parties .
After some discussion , the Parties agreed to consider the subject at the Meeting .
56 . The delegation of Turkey said that its Government wished to apply for developing country status on the grounds that it was considered as a developing country by a number of international organizations , its per capita GNP was US $ 1,300 per annum , and its consumption of controlled substances was only 0.07 kg per capita .
A member of the Bureau of the Second Meeting of the Parties introduced a draft decision recommended by the Bureau for consideration by the Parties .
Many delegations expressed support for the inclusion of Turkey on the list of developing countries .
However , some concern was expressed in connection with Turkey &apos;s application for membership of the EEC and about reopening the list of developing countries in general .
It was pointed out that countries not eligible for support from the Multilateral Fund could apply for assistance through the Global Environment Facility .
There was a consensus that the OpenEnded Working Group of the Parties should be requested to study and further define the criteria to be applied to any new Party seeking classification as a developing country .
One delegation proposed that consideration be given to a new category to include countries which neither contributed to nor received support from the Multilateral Fund .
The Meeting adopted Decision III / 5 .
57 . The Rapporteur announced that the Parties operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , had agreed that the composition of the group of Parties so operating would be as follows for the second year of the operation of the Executive Committee : two seats for Latin America and Caribbean , two seats for Africa and three seats for Asia .
The Asian group had selected Sri Lanka as its third member country in the Committee .
Sri Lanka would occupy that seat for one year after which it would rotate to Africa .
In the third year , the position of the ViceChairman would rotate to the group of Parties operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 and that group had earmarked Asia for that position .
In the same year Brazil would occupy the seat vacated by Mexico , which would resign from the Committee after completion of its second year .
The membership from the group of Parties operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , for the second year would be as follows : Egypt , Ghana , Jordan , Malaysia , Mexico , Sri Lanka and Venezuela .
The membership from that group in the third year will be as follows : Brazil , Egypt , Ghana , Jordan , Malaysia , Venezuela and a member to be nominated by the African Group .
The Rapporteur further reported that , as required by the terms of reference for the Executive Committee , the Group of Parties operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , had selected Mexico for the post of Chairman of the Executive Committee .
A representative of the Parties not operating under Article 5 , Paragraph 1 stated that the members representing this group of Parties in the Executive Committee would continue for the second year and that USA has been selected by this group as the Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee .
The Parties noted the decisions of the two groups of Parties regarding the composition of the Executive Committee .
58 . During discussion of the date and venue for the Fourth Meeting of the Parties , the Parties welcomed the announcement by the delegation of Denmark that its Government wished to host the Meeting .
It was agreed that the Fourth Meeting of the Parties should be convened in September or October 1992 ( Decision III / 18 ) .
The dates would be finalized in cooperation with the Secretariat and circulated as soon as possible .

In such cases , the responsibility for reporting data shall lie with the country of origin as the exporter and the country of final destination as the importer .
Cases of import and reexport should be treated as two separate transactions ; the country of origin would report shipment to the country of intermediate destination , which would subsequently report the import from the country of origin and export to the country of final destination , while the country of final destination would report the import . &quot; ;
( b ) To review all relevant articles of the Montreal Protocol in order to consider the possible consequences of a country which is operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 of the Protocol , exceeding the consumption ceiling of 0.3 kilograms per capita specified in that Article ;
( c ) To discuss measures including possible amendments to the Protocol to clarify the situations of such a Party with respect to the Article 2 control measures and in particular to specify :

- What ( if any ) period should be allowed to the Party to enable it to comply fully with the control measures ;
( d ) To consider the possible implications of a Party losing its Article 5 ( 1 ) status if it is at the time a member of the Executive Committee of the Interim Multilateral Fund ;
Decision III / 14 .

VI . OTHER MATTERS
60 . The representative of Switzerland drew attention to the following statement by the Heads of delegations representing the Governments of Sweden , Finland , Norway , Switzerland , Austria , Germany and Denmark ( replacing the draft resolution proposed in document UNEP / OzL.Pro.3 / CRP.2 ) :
&quot; We , the heads of delegations of Sweden , Finland , Norway , Switzerland , Austria , Germany and Denmark , believe that the recent analysis of the state of the stratospheric ozone layer calls for the adoption of more stringent control measures at the Fourth Meeting of the Parties in 1992 .
We are also of the opinion that the substitution of the controlled substances with transitional substances must be as moderate and temporary as possible .
We note that the London resolution urges the adoption , in accordance with the spirit of the paragraph 11 of Article 2 of the Protocol , of more stringent measures in order to protect the Ozone Layer .
Because of this we express our firm determination to phaseout the production and the consumption of CFCs , halons and carbon tetrachloride controlled by the Montreal Protocol , as soon as possible but not later than the year 1997 and to phaseout 1,1,1trichloroethane ( methyl chloroform ) as soon as possible but not later than the year 2000 .
We also think it is necessary to tighten the timetable agreed upon in the Montreal Protocol taking due account of the special situation of developing countries .
We are also determined to limit by no later than 1995 the use of transitional substances ( HCFCs ) to specific key applications where other more environmentally suitable alternative substances or technologies are not available , and to phaseout their use in those areas as soon as technically feasible . &quot;
61 . The delegation of the Netherlands expressed sympathy with the above statement but commented that the action programme in force in its country would probably result in levels of reduction similar to those described in the above statement and that endorsement of the statement would preclude discussions on more stringent controls currently taking place with representatives of industry at the national level .
An annual report on the phaseout programme was published and could be made available to interested Parties .
62 . One delegation suggested that the agenda for the next meeting of the Parties should include an item covering the status of the reporting of activities by individual countries in compliance with the requirements of articles 4 and 9 of the Montreal Protocol .
63 . The delegate of Germany informed the Meeting that the Federal Government was currently preparing a conference to be held from 24 to 26 February 1992 in Berlin , at which , inter alia , the results of the research activities supported by Germany would be presented .
The conference was intended to provide an opportunity for an international exchange of information and experience , which should also be of special interest to developing countries .
The results would be published in the form of conference proceedings ( also in English ) .
This report would be made available to interested parties , not restricted to participants in the conference .
VII . ADOPTION OF THE REPORT
64 . The Meeting adopted the present report , on the basis of the draft report contained in documents UNEP / OzL.Pro.3 / L.4 and / L.4 Add.1 , 2 , 3 and 4 , at its closing session on 21 June 1991 .
65 . After the usual exchange of courtesies , the President declared the Meeting closed .

The data on each substance should also include isomers &#91; Note 1.1.1. trichloroethane ( methyl chloroform ) does not include 1.1.2. trichloroethane &#93; .
4 . The data reported in accordance with the formats will be used to determine the calculated levels of consumption upon which the control measures are based .
It is thus crucial that data be provided separately for each individual substance listed in the formats .
5 . Please note that both paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 7 provide that the Parties should submit the best possible estimates where actual data are not available .
6 . In accordance with the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Group of Experts on the Reporting Data , which held its first meeting at Nairobi on 6 and 7 December 19910 , the Parties are requested to report on the extra production as allowed to meet the basic domestic needs of countries operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol .
The quantity of the production increase and the country to be supplied by this production increase should be reported under &quot; quantity &quot; and &quot; destination &quot; .
The export figures as well as the production figures reported should include the increased amounts of production for supplying the countries operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 .
The allowable increase in production should also be reported as metric tonnes .
7 . In accordance with the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Group of Experts on the Reporting of Data , which held its first meeting at Nairobi on 6 and 7 December , 1990 , countries having freetrade zones inside their territories should make a special effort to include in their data reporting production , import and export figures for such zones .
8 . In accordance with the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Group of Experts on the Reporting of Data , which held its first meeting at Nairobi on 6 and 7 December 1990 , the quantities of controlled substances used for refilling the refrigeration and fireextinguishing systems of ships in ports should be regarded as forming part of consumption of the country with jurisdiction over the part and should therefore , not , be included in its exports figures .
9 . With regard to the data on &quot; amounts destroyed &quot; , the Parties , decided at their Second Meeting , to establish an Ad Hoc technical advisory committee on destruction technologies to analyse destruction technologies and to assess their efficiency and environmental acceptability , so as to develop approval criteria and measurements .
Separate data on the amounts destroyed need not be reported until such approval criteria are established .

OPENING OF THE SESSION ( item 1 of the provisional agenda )
1 . THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN , speaking as outgoing Chairman of the forty-second session , declared open the forty-third session of the Executive Committee .
The events of the last 12 months seemed to have been more sharply contrasted than those of previous years .
Developments on the more hopeful side , such as the many repatriation operations now under way , the repeated displays of solidarity on the part of the international community and the exemplary spirit of selflessness shown by those involved , could be contrasted with more sombre developments , such as the disquieting political destabilization in certain regions of the world , the increasing number of persons forced to flee their country under often tragic circumstances , and the systematic denial of certain fundamental human rights .
UNHCR was now being confronted on a daily basis by considerable challenges which severely tested not only its reaction capacity and that of its staff , but also its basic principles and its international credibility .
2 . In that connection , UNHCR &apos;s fortieth anniversary , which had been celebrated a few months earlier in the presence of several former High Commissioners , should be a source of encouragement and inspiration .
The High Commissioners had recalled an institution which had consistently adopted a pragmatic approach by adapting its structures and methods to new political climates and to specific new problems .
In each different period , the political will to succeed had made it possible to overcome obstacles that had seemed to be nearly insurmountable .
3 . Today &apos;s challenges took many forms : migratory flows on an unprecedented scale , complex rescue operations involving both governmental and non-governmental agencies , mobilization of resources in a period of budgetary restrictions and the need to adapt international institutions and their governing mechanisms to a profoundly altered environment .
However , if it continued to be inspired by the same political will as in the past , UNHCR would be capable of adjusting its mechanisms and its resources to meet the needs of the present .
4 . He had also derived encouragement from the visit he had made , with the support of the Swiss Government , to Cambodia , Thailand and Bangladesh .
That mission had helped him realize , first , that the tragic lot of those forced to flee their homes must always be central to UNHCR &apos;s concerns .
UNHCR had to be untiring in its efforts to seek satisfactory solutions to the agonizing question of their future .
Secondly , there was a need to recognize the full extent of the burden borne by countries of asylum ; it was clear that more equitable burden sharing was essential .
Thirdly , with the overlapping between the local population and refugees that was a feature of certain situations , it was understandable that social tensions and economic distortions could arise ; UNHCR had to take them into account .
Fourthly , the management of a camp or a repatriation operation was a sophisticated exercise which involved many governmental and non-governmental partners and called for great patience , goodwill , skill and initiative .
Fifthly , the staff of UNHCR and of the many other bodies working in the field under difficult conditions had shown a sense of responsibility and a spirit of self-sacrifice which were wholly admirable .
The attacks made recently in some of the media were unjustified .
5 . After thanking all those who had assisted him in his task , he concluded by quoting Geneva &apos;s motto &quot; Post tenebras lux &quot; and said he was convinced that the more hopeful aspects of the situation he had referred to would prevail over the more sombre ones .

STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN
19 . The CHAIRMAN recalled that , when the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had been founded in Geneva in 1951 , it had been thought that three years would be enough to solve the problem of a small group of persons who had been displaced as a result of the Second World War .
More than 40 years later , however , the problem was still unsolved .
UNHCR now had increasing responsibilities and a role which went beyond assistance and protection .
20 . Referring to the scope of the refugee problem , he reminded the Executive Committee that the situation in the 1950s had arisen as a consequence of the Second World War and that many European refugees had then been taken in by Latin American countries .
The first UNHCR regional office had been set up in Bogota .
In the 1960s , Africa had been the scene of population displacements , particularly in Rwanda , Zaire , Angola and Ethiopia , as a result of conflicts connected with the process of decolonization .
The focus had shifted to Asia in the 1970s , when the boat people had appeared and the most massive exodus of the twentieth century had started because the war in Bangladesh had created 10 million displaced persons .
During that decade , the military Governments of the Southern Cone of Latin America had caused large numbers of persons to flee their homes and many had found refuge in Europe .
The 1980s had seen the displacement of 5 million Afghans to Pakistan and Iran , as well as displacements in Central America , a region then ravaged by civil wars , repression and violence .
In the early 1990s , while problems in Asia , Africa and Latin America persisted , Europe was again experiencing population displacements .
The refugee problem thus no longer characterized a single region , but affected the entire planet .
21 . In addition , refugees , who had numbered 1 million at the beginning of the 1950s had today reached a figure of over 17 million , even without counting those currently being created by the crisis in the Balkan peninsula .
By its very size , that problem called for far more than a policy of humanitarian assistance : it required a political solution , since international peace and security were at stake .
22 . With regard to the nature of the phenomenon underlying UNHCR &apos;s protection mission , he said that the reasons for population displacements in recent years had gone beyond the framework of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol . In addition to fears of persecution for reasons of race , religion , nationality or opinion , there were fears created by armed conflicts , economic and social distress and chronic natural disasters .
Suddenly , the traditional concept of &quot; refugee &quot; was no longer adequate to encompass the problem posed by the displacement of millions of human beings .
That was why the Sub-Committee of the Whole on International Protection had undertaken to examine , and was still studying , a whole set of conceptual problems relating to the legal status of refugees , as well as such questions as the situation of persons failing to meet the requirements defined by the 1951 Convention , the criterion governing the cessation of refugee status and the definition of &quot; safe haven &quot; .
Those questions gave rise to varying reactions , since every region , if not every country , tended to view solutions in terms of its history , its culture and its geographical location .
23 . The conceptual and practical problems which were involved in protection and were not always covered by the existing rules had already been discussed at length , but it was as yet too early to think about amending the protection regime established under the existing conventions .
What could most usefully be done at the present stage was to consider what guidelines could be given to the High Commissioner in order to facilitate her humanitarian task .
The fundamental objective of protection was to find lasting humanitarian solutions , which would be in conformity with the basic principles of asylum and , most importantly , of non-refoulement .
It meant , on the one hand , day-by-day protection of individuals or groups which had left their country and whose fundamental rights were no longer guaranteed and , on the other , the consolidation and updating of the legal regime governing the status and rights of refugees. page
24 . Latin America , for its part , had been supporting the refugee cause for over a century : the Treaty of Montevideo , which had been the first to include the legal concept of political asylum , had been signed in 1889 .
The 1928 Havana Convention and the 1933 Montevideo Convention , which developed that concept further , had also inspired the 1951 United Nations Convention .
The effectiveness of asylum as a means of dealing with dramatic situations had once again been recognized by the Plan of Action agreed on by the 1989 International Conference on Central American Refugees , which had had considerable success in alleviating the problems of refugees in the region concerned .
25 . The challenges which UNHCR had to face were on a scale commensurate with the distress and despair suffered by refugee mothers and children and by entire refugee families .
In the belief that life was worth more than law , UNHCR had had the courage to carry out its programme of humanitarian activities even when , as was so often the case , they went beyond the bounds prescribed by legislation .
More than any other United Nations agency , UNHCR had thus taken a moral stand which had won it the trust of the international community and had enabled it to act in very difficult situations with prudence and without political bias - whether in intervening with Governments or participating in voluntary repatriation programmes - to bring assistance to human beings pushed to the limit of distress by being forced to flee their homes for fear of physical violence and persecution .
The moral dimension of the activities of the Office which Mrs. Ogata headed so effectively also put it in a good position to meet the demands that the international community would continue to make of it as new difficulties and complex new situations arose .
26 . Such situations were inevitable , since history was not predictable : from UNHCR &apos;s establishment until the beginning of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia , wars had killed 20 million persons , 12 million of whom had fallen victim to civil wars in developing countries .
Moreover , history seemed to have reached a turning point and the face of the world , along with the concepts and ideas it carried with it , would now have to change .
27 . Through its work , UNHCR was helping to create a climate of trust and solidarity , a vital prerequisite for international peace and security .
In the new international context , it should therefore link its humanitarian assistance and protection tasks more closely with efforts to improve coexistence between States within the international system of which they were a part .
In carrying out the functions of Chairman of the Executive Committee , he pledged to cooperate fully with all delegations in furthering those objectives .
ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS ( item 3 of the provisional agenda ) ( A / AC.96 / XLIII / L.1 )
28 . The provisional agenda ( A / AC.96 / XLIII / L.1 ) was adopted .
29 . The CHAIRMAN proposed that the Executive Committee should consider at a later stage , under item 7 , all applications from governmental delegations for observer status at informal meetings of the Committee and at meetings of its Sub-Committees , in accordance with the decision taken at its thirty-ninth session ( A / 43 / 12 / Add.1 , para . 35 ) .
30 . It was so decided .
GENERAL DEBATE ( agenda item 4 )
31 . Mrs. OGATA ( United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ) welcomed all those present at the current session of the Executive Committee .
She was particularly pleased to welcome the delegations of Hungary and Ethiopia , which were participating as members in the Committee &apos;s annual session for the first time .
She thanked the outgoing Chairman for the advice he had given UNHCR in the course of a year which had put it severely to the test in every area .
She was sure that she could count on the new Bureau for the necessary support in confronting the challenges of the months ahead .
32 . The past year had been a turbulent one : no fewer than 3 million people had been forced to flee in search of safety , while another 1.5 million refugees had returned home voluntarily .
The situation had been particularly tragic in Africa .
Over 1 million Somalis , fleeing famine , chaos and internal conflicts , had sought asylum in Djibouti , in Ethiopia , in Kenya and in the Yemen .
Although the signing of a general peace agreement on Mozambique was to be welcomed , the fact remained that the exodus to Malawi and Zimbabwe had gathered momentum as a result of the drought - only one fifth of urgently needed food supplies had actually reached the inhabitants of that devastated region .
In West Africa , some 800,000 refugees from Liberia and Sierra Leone still had no solution to their problem in sight .
The media did not always give the same publicity to all refugee situations and UNHCR was striving to redress the balance through its public information strategy .
33 . Certain regions of Asia were also experiencing crises .
She was continuing to collaborate closely with the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs to overcome the difficulties created by the return to Myanmar of 265,000 refugees who had fled to neighbouring Bangladesh and to ensure an international presence in Myanmar .
It had been necessary to strengthen UNHCR &apos;s presence in Nepal and to take a series of emergency response measures to deal with an influx of asylum seekers from Bhutan .
In South-East Asia , in contrast , voluntary repatriations to Viet Nam , the Lao People &apos;s Democratic Republic and Cambodia had continued at a steady pace - so far , over 30,000 Vietnamese had returned home .
However , the situation of refugees remaining in first asylum countries was still far from being resolved .
34 . In Central America , continued progress had been made towards durable solutions as a result of the International Conference on Central American Refugees .
The reintegration of returnees was about to enter the realm of development phase and UNDP would shortly be taking over the process .
The Peace Accord concluded in El Salvador had consolidated the reconciliation process .
The launching of the first phase of the Plan of Action for Repatriation to Guatemala and the establishment of a UNHCR presence in the major target zones were significant steps towards the solution of the remaining refugee problem in that part of the world .
In Haiti , however , the deteriorating economic situation , the absence of political solutions and the harshness of sanctions had combined to keep alive the risk of a major exodus .
In that connection , it was important for Governments in the region to maintain an open humanitarian policy .
35 . In the Middle East , there was reason to fear that the deteriorating situation in northern Iraq , the difficulties involved in the renewal of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Government and the onset of winter might lead to new outflows of Kurdish refugees .
To prevent such an eventuality , there was an urgent need to build up stocks for the winter and to review cross-border operations .
36 . In Europe , over 2.6 million persons had been displaced or were under siege as a result of the conflict now raging in the former Yugoslavia .
UNHCR had launched a comprehensive humanitarian operation to aid the victims , which had been broadly endorsed by the international ministerial meeting convened on 29 July 1992 .
That crisis had reminded the world that no region was safe from the refugee problem and had given fresh impetus to the debate on the concepts underlying protection of refugees and displaced persons and prevention of refugee flows .
37 . It was not yet possible to assess the consequences of the brutal changes which had taken place on the international scene and which , in some cases , had led to the break-up of the State and , in others , to the breakdown of Government authority .
The dynamics of displacement had evolved and become more complex , while the ethnic factor was today a common denominator in many refugee problems .
As humanitarian action increasingly became part of a wider process for restoring peace in a changing world , the last 12 months had given a new dimension to UNHCR &apos;s role and confronted it with new kinds of difficulties .
38 . As to activities undertaken in 1992 , lessons learned and what still remained to be done , she stressed that her goal was to strengthen UNHCR &apos;s response capacity and emergency preparedness and to cooperate more closely with other agencies , donors and non-governmental organizations .
Measures had been taken to establish emergency response teams , to diversify emergency training and to stockpile basic relief supplies .
Standby agreements had been concluded with a number of non-governmental organizations for the secondment of staff .
The skills of the United Nations Volunteers had been called upon on a number of occasions .
Those new arrangements had played a key role in UNHCR &apos;s ability to respond to recent crises .
39 . However , the effectiveness of UNHCR &apos;s action in emergencies was also determined by the prevailing security situation .
Humanitarian crises were increasingly tending to arise in the midst of armed conflict and UNHCR was having to provide protection and assistance to the displaced in conditions of insecurity and anarchy .
In that connection , she paid tribute to all those who were working in the field , at great personal risk , to keep the relief pipeline open and , above all , to the staff of UNHCR , the United Nations , non-governmental and other organizations who had lost their lives in the defence of that cause .
The meeting on security matters held at the request of UNHCR at the level of the United Nations system had resulted in a number of concrete recommendations , which had already begun to be implemented .
In the face of emergencies on an unprecedented scale , UNHCR had had to turn on occasion to the armed forces for logistical support - in the post-cold war era , there was everything to be gained by channelling the enormous capacity of the military to serve humanitarian purposes .
40 . Emergency response should be coupled with energetic political initiatives to promote the safe and voluntary return of refugees .
Although the fact that 1.5 million refugees had been repatriated in 1992 was to be welcomed , it should be recognized that refugee movements had become more and more difficult to control and that , as a result , returns had become more complex and precarious .
41 . In Mozambique , Liberia and South Africa , drought , food shortages , conflicts and political confrontations had been a set-back to hopes of rapid repatriation .
In addition , although over 60,000 refugees had returned spontaneously to Angola , fragile security and the presence of large numbers of mines continued to slow down progress towards solutions , even though difficulties were gradually being overcome as new funding was received .
UNHCR had also made arrangements for the voluntary repatriation of Burundi refugees from the United Republic of Tanzania .
It was taking an active part in negotiations and activities under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) with a view to finding a solution to the plight of Rwandese refugees .
42 . The situation in Afghanistan clearly illustrated the difficulties posed by repatriation today .
Over 1 million Afghans who had fled to Pakistan and to the Islamic Republic of Iran had returned to their country in 1992 , but the explosive situation and the climate of insecurity prevailing in Afghanistan were seriously hampering the funding and implementation of reintegration and rehabilitation measures .
The Secretary-General and the Under-Secretary-General , Mr. Eliasson , had been warned that , unless all agencies and donors were vigorously and urgently mobilized , there was a risk that a further humanitarian catastrophe might occur with the onset of winter .
43 . Repatriation was a difficult undertaking , often more complex politically and operationally than emergency response .
Although planning and preparation played an important part , the key element was still innovation and flexibility , as had been shown by UNHCR &apos;s operations in Cambodia .
Within the framework of the 1991 Paris Peace Agreements , some 130,000 Cambodians had returned to date , mainly from Thailand .
Barring a major setback , UNHCR expected all Cambodian refugees in Thailand to have been repatriated by early 1993 , in time to take part in the elections .
In order to meet that deadline , however , it had had to modify assistance options to take account of the lack of available , mine-free land for allocation to returnees .
Despite the difficulties , the sustained political will of the international community should make it possible to secure the long-term future of such returnees .
44 . In south-eastern Ethiopia , a new initiative had been launched which abandoned traditional distinctions between refugees , returnees and the affected population .
UNHCR had worked in association with other United Nations and non-governmental organizations to assess and meet the needs of the entire community and thus stabilize the population , with a view to breaking the vicious circle of exile , return and internal displacement , followed by renewed exile to an area of chronic under-development , drought and instability .
45 . Those repatriation operations underlined the importance of quick-impact development projects to bridge the gap between relief and longer-term development .
In association with UNDP and other agencies , UNHCR had made significant progress in that area , within the framework of the International Conference on Central American Refugees .
The lessons learned in that part of the world were now being applied in Cambodia .
46 . However , much remained to be done and the respective roles and responsibilities of the agencies at various stages of the relief-to-development continuum needed to be clarified and dovetailed .
Indeed , that was an area where an improvement in inter-agency coordination was urgently needed and the extent to which the international community was able to meet the development challenge would affect UNHCR &apos;s ability to maintain the impetus in repatriation and to find genuine and lasting solutions to refugee problems .
47 . The other lasting solution provided by resettlement , in cases where the lives or fundamental well-being of refugees depended on it , should also not be overlooked .
With the proliferation of refugee crises around the world , the need for resettlement places had grown and UNHCR was counting on the generosity of the international community , especially on behalf of detainees being released in the former Yugoslavia .
48 . After enhancing emergency response and promoting solutions leading to repatriation , prevention was the third cornerstone of UNHCR &apos;s strategy .
Given the close links between serious human rights violations and refugee flows , it had sought to reinforce contacts with human rights bodies within the United Nations system and was actively participating in preparations for the World Conference on Human Rights .
Together with other organizations and with the help of some Governments , it had stepped up its training and advisory activities as a part of efforts to establish institutions in eastern Europe and in the CIS countries to pre-empt and manage the problems of massive displacements .
49 . UNHCR had undertaken increasingly effective initiatives to provide protection and assistance to displaced populations within countries of origin , notably in the former Yugoslavia , Sri Lanka and the Horn of Africa .
Experience in the former Yugoslavia had shown that an international presence was an essential element of prevention .
While it was difficult to quantify its effects with any accuracy and while it did not always succeed in preventing forced displacements , it nevertheless enabled the international community to see to it that populations were given humanitarian treatment and it could have restraining effects .
50 . Like solutions , prevention should be applied with imagination and flexibility to each situation encountered .
Thus , in the context of the Somali crisis , UNHCR &apos;s prevention activities had taken the form of supplying food , tools and essential commodities from Kenya , where UNHCR was based , so that people were not compelled to cross borders in search of humanitarian assistance .
UNHCR was coordinating that aid as part of a comprehensive United Nations plan to accelerate relief operations in that war-torn country .
51 . Such cross-border operations had considerable implications in terms of resources and , in order to be effective , required the full and entire cooperation of the agencies , the acquiescence of the parties concerned and the wholehearted commitment of the international community .
Assistance to internally displaced persons , as in Yugoslavia , could be successful only to the extent that their safety could be assured and an early solution found ; it was thus entirely dependent on the political will of the parties concerned .
Although prevention was a promising strategy , it also had its limits .
It could not be a substitute for asylum , but was rather a supplement to it .
52 . International protection had always been the basis of UNHCR &apos;s three-pronged strategy .
The focus of protection had always been to meet refugees &apos; needs from the time of flight until the achievement of a durable solution .
However , the sheer scale and complexity of contemporary population displacements had placed serious strains on that orthodox approach to refugee protection , had weakened international solidarity and had sometimes seriously jeopardized the principle of asylum .
Whatever the part of the world concerned , the question had arisen as to how heavy a burden countries of asylum could legitimately tolerate : as a result , it was vital that international protection should be given a coherent yet flexible framework which safeguarded fundamental principles and premises , while at the same time taking into account current realities and enabling UNHCR to play a creative role , not only in addressing the problems of refugees , but also in solving the refugee problem .
53 . It was with that objective in mind that she had set up an internal working group , chaired by the Director of International Protection , to recommend a strategy for strengthening international protection in the 1990s .
The conclusions of that working group had been submitted to the Executive Committee in the Note on International Protection ( A / AC.96 / 799 ) .
She hoped that the Committee would endorse the new thrust which underlay many of the Office &apos;s current activities .
54 . The Note did not seek to redefine UNHCR &apos;s mandate or to extend its competence to new groups of persons .
Rather , it reflected realities and affirmed UNHCR &apos;s willingness to play a clearly defined role in the prevention and solution of refugee problems .
There was also no question of substituting protection in the country of origin for traditional humanitarian action on behalf of refugees and asylum seekers .
The institution of asylum had to be preserved and efforts continued to establish efficient and fair procedure which would ensure that valid claims to refugee status were recognized .
At the same time , UNHCR should show sufficient flexibility to develop concerted and comprehensive regional arrangements which could successfully solve specific problems of displacement in different regions of the world .
55 . A regional arrangement which combined a commitment to provide protection for those who needed it , clear policies for immigration and development assistance and a coherent information strategy could help to solve the problem of mixed movements of refugees and migrants in Europe .
She hoped that the rationalization of UNHCR &apos;s priorities , structures and resources in Europe would help to strengthen its ability to engage Governments and other actors in a constructive dialogue with a view to adopting a regional approach .
56 . It was evident that the magnitude of the challenges exceeded the capacity of UNHCR alone .
Whether prevention , protection or solutions were involved the execution of coherent and comprehensive strategies meant that new impetus had to be given to the existing partnership between UNHCR and Governments , other United Nations agencies and international , regional and non-governmental organizations .
Indeed , the Office had rarely enjoyed such close cooperation or received such strong encouragement from Governments .
She was deeply grateful to them for their support , whether diplomatic , political , financial or human .
There were close operational links between UNHCR and its sister agencies , particularly WFP and UNICEF , as well as with IOM .
The Office &apos;s collaboration with the Department of Humanitarian Affairs continued to be fruitful and its relations with ICRC were gaining in depth day by day with its repeated interventions in areas of conflict .
Lastly , she wished to pay tribute to the many non-governmental organizations which had given ample proof of their commitment and which were the spearhead of many aspects of refugee operations , often under the most difficult of conditions .
57 . The many different actors on the scene made the question of coordination even more crucial .
Coordination , however , was not a panacea .
It required considerable investment in terms of time and energy and could not in any circumstances be a substitute for the individual or collective capacity of agencies .
The objective of coordination should be to enhance comparative advantages .
Furthermore , in the case of complex humanitarian actions , coordination could best be ensured on the basis of the principle of assigning one agency the lead role , such as that assumed by UNHCR in refugee or refugee-like situations as in northern Iraq and now in former Yugoslavia .
Public opinion was also among UNHCR &apos;s concerns in that regard , especially at a time when racism and xenophobia were on the increase in some parts of the world .
UNHCR had therefore stepped up its public information campaign in order to build greater support for the humanitarian values and traditions in whose name it had been created .
She urged all political leaders and opinion-makers to join UNHCR in stemming the tide of intolerance against refugees and asylum seekers .
58 . Lastly , she referred to the problem of UNHCR &apos;s resources .
Unlike other agencies of the United Nations system , UNHCR could hardly be selective in assuming its responsibilities .
It could not avoid them when a new crisis occurred and when the international community urged it to take action .
What it could and should do was constantly to look for ways of better managing and utilizing its resources .
One year of unprecedented need had been followed by yet another .
Out of US $ 1.1 billion - the estimated total of its needs - UNHCR had received US $ 751.9 million as at 29 September 1992 .
She was grateful to those who had made those contributions , particularly as the donor base had widened .
However , she felt bound to appeal to &quot; traditional &quot; donors not to reduce their contributions at a time when needs were constantly increasing .
Furthermore , she planned to undertake a number of personal initiatives later in the year to diversify sources of governmental funding .
Encouraged by the significant increase in private funding , she was continuing her approaches in that area .
59 . As operational challenges become more complex , UNHCR needed continuously to reassess both its approach to programmes and its management and monitoring systems .
Its capacity and the capacity of its operational partners for needs assessment and programme design had to be markedly improved , so that the effectiveness of programmes could be measured against clear objectives .
In the course of the coming year , she intended to take steps to enhance UNHCR &apos;s programming skills .
Efforts to strengthen the Office &apos;s financial accountability should be matched by increased effectiveness in programme delivery .
60 . Such measures should also help UNHCR respond better to the needs of the majority of refugees or , in other words , women and children .
Training activities now under way were designed to provide staff with the necessary tools to incorporate the guidelines on refugee women into programme design and implementation .
Thanks to the generosity of the Norwegian Government , UNHCR would from now on have the benefit of the services of a Coordinator for Refugee Children .
She hoped that the Office would be able to develop educational opportunities for such children with a view to enabling them to overcome the trauma of exile and to face the future bravely once they returned home .
61 . Better programming should also go hand in hand with a more ecological approach .
UNHCR had explained its policy on the subject in a conference room paper and hoped that the necessary funding would be made available to enable it to appoint a coordinator on environmental issues .
62 . Management of funds and programmes was indissolubly linked to the question of human resources .
The huge number of emergencies that UNHCR had had to deal with over the past two years had placed a heavy burden on the shoulders of its staff , who had proved equal to the challenge .
However , if the Office was to maintain the same standards of competence and commitment , it would need to manage its human resources more carefully and creatively .
Its staff , who were being constantly called on to respond to emergencies or to cope with priority tasks , were moving from one operation to another or else were being hurriedly recruited in a way which satisfied neither their own career aspirations nor the needs of sound management .
As a result , there was need for a coherent policy which took account of UNHCR &apos;s current role and responsibilities .
She intended personally to undertake a qualitative review of UNHCR &apos;s staffing requirements and to devise a human resources strategy which would enable the Office to respond efficiently to the challenges of the post-cold war era .
In addition , a dynamic and rational policy had been adopted to redress the gender imbalance within UNHCR .
63 . The six points of prevention , preparedness , protection , solutions , partnership and resources represented in a nutshell the tremendous challenges with which UNHCR was confronted .
In conclusion , she recalled that her predecessor , Mr. Stoltenberg , had told the Committee that he hoped that the issue of population movements would be placed on the international political agenda .
Today it was on that agenda and it was through political initiatives that the root causes of displacement could be addressed .
It was also through political agreement that durable solutions could be found for refugee problems .
Humanitarian action could pave the way for political action , but could never be a substitute for it .
64 . As humanitarian action became linked with peacemaking and peace-keeping efforts , UNHCR &apos;s task was to see to it that the question of refugees and displacement remained on the political agenda , while at the same time preserving its non-political and humanitarian approach .
The task of political bodies was to support humanitarian action , while resisting the temptation to use humanitarian avenues to overcome political obstacles .
Nor should political action jeopardize the speed , efficiency and neutrality of humanitarian aid .
Political bodies and humanitarian agencies needed to work hand in hand .
UNHCR should remain wary of the dangers , lest they engulf it , and should be prepared to seize opportunities , lest they escape it .
Despite the inherent contradictions of the era which was now beginning , it was with an acute sense of responsibility and a feeling of intense satisfaction that UNHCR was continuing its work .
It was aware of the vital importance of humanitarian action in the post-cold war period and it also knew that it was serving a noble cause and was proud of the fact that a large number of voluntary returns had been recorded over the past 12 months .
UNHCR was operating at the extreme limits of its capacity , but , thanks to the extraordinary support of the international community and of the Executive Committee , it was ready and willing to continue with its humanitarian task .
66 . Mrs. LAFONTANT-MANKARIOUS ( United States of America ) said that , shortly after the Executive Committee &apos;s adoption , at its forty-second session , of the High Commissioner &apos;s plan for responding to emergency situations , a spate of emergencies had begun which had strained the reserves of all humanitarian agencies beyond their operational limits .
UNHCR &apos;s actions in the former Yugoslavia , the Horn of Africa and northern Iraq had subjected it to criticism by the public , which judged it according to the speed and effectiveness of its operations , whereas in fact it was obliged to coordinate its activities with those of a wide range of United Nations agencies , private institutions and donors .
67 . While commending UNHCR for its handling of the refugee situation in Myanmar , she urged the Government of that country to accept the presence of UNHCR monitors , so that refugees who had already indicated a willingness to return to their countries would be able to do so .
At the same time , the Government of Bangladesh should maintain an open door to asylum seekers and work with UNHCR on voluntary repatriation efforts .
The United States , which had contributed generously to UNHCR &apos;s programme in Bangladesh , appealed to other donors not to forget the many refugees who did not make newspaper headlines .
In Bhutan , over 100,000 persons of Bhutanese origin had fled to India and then to western Nepal to seek refuge .
Thanks to its new emergency response mechanism , UNHCR had responded with speed and efficiency and had saved many lives .
68 . On the subject of international protection , UNHCR had clearly demonstrated , by its comprehensive response to the humanitarian crisis in the Republics of the former Yugoslavia and in northern Iraq , the need to combine emergency response with protection activities .
It was likely that the international community would continue to request the Office to intervene in situations where refugees , internally displaced persons and affected civilian populations were intermingled .
Similarly , the United States welcomed the Note on International Protection ( A / AC.96 / 799 ) , which was an important contribution to the international debate on refugee protection .
At the same time , the Executive Committee should recognize that constraints of personnel , of financing and perhaps of mandate might prevent UNHCR from taking on all the additional responsibilities considered in the document .
69 . The United States welcomed UNHCR &apos;s use in 1992 of general programme funds for voluntary repatriation activities , particularly in Angola .
In Afghanistan and Cambodia , it had capitalized on political will to achieve significant success in 1992 .
The United States was proud to have contributed nearly US $ 31 million to those three important repatriation programmes .
70 . It was imperative that UNHCR &apos;s general programme budget proposals should be consistent with the guidelines approved by the Executive Committee .
If that were to be achieved , general programmes should be stepped up and priorities reoriented , while UNHCR &apos;s programme capacity should be strengthened .
With the emergencies now building up in the Horn of Africa and in southern Africa , an increase in the general programme budget would probably be needed .
71 . The protection of women and children was not yet of significant concern to many UNHCR field officers , despite the policies and guidelines laid down by the Executive Committee and its Sub-Committees on the subject .
The number of women who were still victims of rape was the best example of the failure of traditional protection measures .
The time had come to guarantee the physical protection of refugee women by ensuring that there were female field officers present in every emergency situation .
Similarly , UNHCR programmes should be more closely linked to the needs of the vast majority of refugees , namely , women and children , and care should be taken to prevent programming mistakes .
If necessary , her Government would be willing to assist in funding that effort by an increase in the general programme budget .
72 . At the June meeting of the Executive Committee , the High Commissioner had proposed that emergency humanitarian operations should be carried out in partnership with other agencies . She herself fully supported the coordination of UNHCR &apos;s activities with those of the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs , Mr. Jan Eliasson .
She further welcomed UNHCR &apos;s collaboration with UNDP in Central America and hoped that returning Angolans would benefit from the Special Relief Programme in Angola .
73 . Mr. MORLAND ( United Kingdom ) , speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States , said that , in 1992 , UNHCR had had to take on a particularly heavy workload , especially in Europe and Africa , in addition to the many critical situations it was already having to face all over the world .
In Europe , in the former Yugoslav Republics , more than 2.5 million people had been forced to leave their homes as a result of conflicts and deliberate persecution in the name of &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; , a practice unreservedly condemned by the Community and its member States .
He welcomed the appointment of UNHCR as the lead agency in that humanitarian crisis and also paid tribute to the role of UNPROFOR in delivering humanitarian aid under difficult circumstances .
The Community and its member States , which had made substantial cash and food contributions , had also participated in the airlift to Sarajevo , provided logistical support and helped UNHCR and local authorities prepare winter shelter .
However , he remained convinced that the best way of helping the majority of victims was by delivering relief to their homes or at least as near as possible to their place of origin .
74 . Africa , with almost one third of the world &apos;s total number of refugees , was facing problems on an unprecedented scale .
Clearly , the tragic events that were occurring in the Horn of Africa were beyond the scope of any one agency .
In addition to the active role played by ICRC , he therefore welcomed the coordination of the activities of United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations working under the umbrella of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs .
The Community and its member States had already responded swiftly and generously to United Nations humanitarian programmes in Africa , a continent which was also suffering from a disastrous drought , and they would continue to do so .
75 . Despite those and other emergencies to which it had had to respond , UNHCR had nevertheless been able to record some progress in its voluntary repatriation programmes .
Thus , in Cambodia , some 140,000 people had returned home from Thailand , Indonesia and Malaysia under UNHCR auspices .
In addition , at the beginning of the year , some 1.8 million Iraqi refugees who had fled to Iran and Turkey had returned home voluntarily .
Thanks to UNHCR &apos;s winterization programmes and to the efforts of a number of non-governmental organizations , the people of northern Iraq had begun to rebuild 1,700 villages which had been destroyed .
With the ending of the emergency phase , other United Nations agencies had taken over from UNHCR , but , since that time , the Government of Iraq had continually obstructed the United Nations in its attempts to deliver humanitarian assistance .
In the south of the country too , the United Nations presence had been severely restricted .
The Community and its member States condemned such actions , which could only perpetuate the suffering already inflicted on the population by its own Government .
It was in Afghanistan , as a result of the political changes that had taken place the previous April , that the largest number of voluntary repatriations had been achieved .
Unfortunately , the hostilities that had recently broken out in Kabul had resulted in further population displacements .
76 . If the High Commissioner &apos;s hope of a decade of voluntary repatriation was to be fulfilled , UNHCR would need to have the capacity to respond quickly to changes in the political climate .
In December 1991 , the Sub-Committee on Administrative and Financial Matters had decided to include US $ 18 million in the 1992 general programmes target for voluntary repatriation and had agreed that that provision should be maintained in future years .
In the belief that voluntary repatriation should be at the heart of UNHCR &apos;s programmes , the Community and its member States strongly supported that change .
However , UNHCR aid , which was limited in time , could not in itself guarantee the future of returnees .
The Community and its member States therefore welcomed the establishment of the Inter-Agency Working Group on the Reintegration of Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons , which had held its first meeting in January .
77 . In addition , the Community and its member States greatly valued the dialogue which was already under way between UNHCR , Governments , member States and the Commission of the European Communities .
The regular meetings of the Sub-Committee on Administrative and Financial Matters had been particularly useful in drawing the attention of Governments to many important issues concerning the running of UNHCR , including income and expenditure , staffing and key programme activities such as voluntary repatriation .
78 . In addition , over the past year , the Sub-Committee on International Protection had for the first time held a regular series of meetings .
Given the complexity of today &apos;s refugee situations and the expansion of UNHCR &apos;s activities , protection should form an integral part of the Office &apos;s activities .
It would therefore be useful if , at future meetings , the Sub-Committee could consider protection issues in the context of UNHCR &apos;s actual programmes , with contributions , as appropriate , from the Office &apos;s geographical divisions , as well as from its jurists .
In that context , he welcomed the Note on International Protection prepared by the Working Group on International Protection .
The Community and its member States were ready to play their full part in discussing and developing the important ideas it contained , such as UNHCR &apos;s role in the country of origin , group determination and safety zones .
79 . The number of asylum seekers had continued to rise in western Europe , reaching an estimated 545,000 by the end of 1991 .
More than 3 million persons had claimed asylum in Europe since 1984 , creating social strains which had become openly apparent in some countries in 1992 .
Without repudiating the obligations they had contracted under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol , the Community and its member States could not ignore the huge increase in the number of manifestly unfounded requests for asylum or the fact that a very large proportion of applicants had become displaced illegally within the European Community without taking up opportunities for protection available to them closer to home .
Such abuses diverted staff and other resources from more productive activities , undermined the natural sympathy felt for refugees and jeopardized the interests of the small minority in genuine need of protection .
The member States of the European Community fully endorsed the Working Group &apos;s conclusion that asylum was an essential option .
However , the right to seek and to enjoy asylum did not entail the right to travel to a particular country in order to apply for it .
A more effective distinction had to be made between genuine protection needs and the migration preferences expressed by individuals .
In that regard , he reminded the Executive Committee that the refoulement of rejected applicants was a matter for the discretion of individual States , in accordance with national immigration laws .
80 . UNHCR &apos;s budget , which was already well in excess of US $ 1 billion in 1992 , was a reflection of the enormous demands placed upon it .
In the course of the financial year that had just elapsed , the Community and its member States had together contributed nearly 40 per cent of UNHCR &apos;s total budget .
In 1992 , it had still been the Office &apos;s principal donor and had also provided increased logistic and practical support .
In that connection , he urged all Governments to give financial or other support to UNHCR &apos;s activities or to increase the contribution they were already making .
81 . The unprecedented scale and complexity of humanitarian situations raised fundamental questions about UNHCR &apos;s capacity to respond effectively and about the role of the Executive Committee in guiding UNHCR &apos;s work .
With the decline in the proportion of the budget devoted to general programmes , which represented UNHCR &apos;s core expenditure , the way in which the annual budget had traditionally been considered was now open to question .
The size and nature of UNHCR &apos;s staff and its relationship with Governments , other United Nations agencies and its implementing partners in the field needed to be reviewed in the light of the new problems and opportunities facing UNHCR .
Those issues should be examined thoroughly both in the Executive Committee and in the Sub-Committee on Administrative and Financial Matters .
In that regard , the Community and its member States fully supported UNHCR &apos;s efforts to define priorities and to redeploy its activities in Europe .
82 . In conclusion , he paid tribute to the memory of UNHCR staff members who had met a tragic death in the service of the humanitarian cause .
The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.

1 . At its forty-fourth session , in 1992 , the General Assembly adopted resolution 47 / 33 of 25 November 1992 entitled &quot; Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its forty-fourth session &quot; .
2 . Paragraphs 4 , 5 and 6 of the resolution read as follows :
&#91; &quot; The General Assembly , &#93;
Takes note with appreciation of chapter II of the report of the International Law Commission , entitled &quot; Draft Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind &quot; , which was devoted to the question of the possible establishment of an international criminal jurisdiction ;
&quot; 5 . Invites States to submit to the Secretary-General , if possible before the forty-fifth session of the International Law Commission , written comments on the report of the Working Group on the question of an international criminal jurisdiction ; 1 /
&quot; 6 . Requests the International Law Commission to continue its work on this question by undertaking the project for the elaboration of a draft statute for an international criminal court as a matter of priority as from its next session , beginning with an examination of the issues identified in the report of the Working Group and in the debate in the Sixth Committee with a view to drafting a statute on the basis of the report of the Working Group , taking into account the views expressed during the debate in the Sixth Committee as well as any written comments received from States , and to submit a progress report to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session ; &quot;

AUSTRALIA
&#91; Original : English &#93;
&#91; 3 May 1993 &#93;
1 . Australia provides the following comments on the report of the Working Group of the International Law Commission ( ILC ) on the question of an international criminal jurisdiction .
The structure of the comments closely follows that of the Working Group report .
2 . Australia supported the granting of a mandate to the ILC to prepare a draft statute for an international criminal court .
Australia hopes that its comments assist the ILC in this task .
Australia does reserve its position on the draft statute that is ultimately prepared by the ILC .
GENERAL COMMENTS
3 . In its intervention during the debate on this issue in the Sixth Committee on 28 October 1992 , Australia assessed the general approach of the Working Group and noted the importance of the following elements of that approach :
- The detachment of the statute of an international criminal court from the Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind ;
- The confinement of the jurisdiction of an international criminal court , at least in the first phase of its operation , to individuals and not States ;
- The establishment of an essentially voluntary jurisdiction for such a court , which would be concurrent with that of national courts ;
- The establishment of such a court , at least in the first phase of its operations , as a facility to be called upon in need , rather than a standing full-time body .
4 . Australia wishes to underline the importance of these elements and asks the ILC to give them due weight in its work on a draft statute .
SPECIFIC COMMENTS
Structural and jurisdictional issues
The method of creation of a court
5 . Australia agrees with the conclusion of the Working Group expressed in paragraph 437 that an international criminal court should be established under its own statute taking the form of a treaty . English
The composition of a court
6 . Australia has already noted the importance of the Working Group &apos;s view expressed in paragraph 438 of the report that a court , at least in the first phase of its operations , should not be a full-time body but constituted on each occasion it was required to sit .
This position reflects an understanding of the limited workload that a court would face , at least in its early years of operation , and the costs that would be incurred in establishing and maintaining a court on a full-time basis with a full complement of judges and a supporting administrative structure .
The workload of a court would also clearly be more limited if it exercised concurrent jurisdiction with national courts rather than exclusive jurisdiction .
7 . In paragraph 440 of the report , the Working Group rightly points out that judges of a court should be independent and impartial and equipped with suitable qualifications and experience .
Similar requirements are laid down for judges of the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) in Article 2 of that Court &apos;s Statute .
There should also be a requirement ( akin to Art. 9 of the ICJ Statute ) that the judges chosen to sit on a court should represent the &quot; principal legal systems of the world &quot; .
8 . In paragraphs 442 and 443 of the report , the Working Group sets out one possible arrangement for nominating judges to serve on a court and constituting it when required .
Although this arrangement has merit , the ILC should canvass other possible mechanisms to ensure that all relevant issues are fully considered .
Such an arrangement should not be cumbersome but built on a simple framework which provides guarantees for the nomination of qualified judges and the speedy convening of a panel of suitable judges to try a given case .
The ways by which a State might accept the jurisdiction of a court
9 . Paragraph 444 of the report restates the Working Group &apos;s view that a court should not have compulsory jurisdiction .
Australia has noted the importance of this view .
The establishment of a voluntary jurisdiction for a court would require a mechanism by which States could accept this jurisdiction .
As outlined in paragraph 444 , a State becoming a party to the Statute would accept &quot; certain administrative obligations &quot; .
The acceptance of a court &apos;s jurisdiction by a State would be done by separate act .
As noted by the Working Group , this act could be similar to acceptance of the Optional Clause of the ICJ Statute .
10 . Any mechanism for accepting the jurisdiction of a court would have to allow States flexibility in nominating the terms upon which they would accept that jurisdiction .
Paragraph 446 of the report suggests various approaches to handling this question .
In drafting the provisions of the statute on jurisdiction , the ILC should precisely define the terms on which a State may accept the jurisdiction of a court .
Such provisions would need to contain a list of specific offences in relation to which a State could accept a court &apos;s jurisdiction .
The ILC will also need to bear in mind that many States would no doubt have to reconcile national constitutional requirements with the acceptance of the jurisdiction of a court .
These requirements may cover trial format , trial procedures and procedural safeguards .
11 . In paragraph 448 of the report , the Working Group considers the question of access to a court by States which are not party to its statute .
The Working Group favours access to a court being available to States not parties to the statute on an ad hoc basis .
Australia considers this approach should be encouraged as it would enhance acceptance of a court &apos;s role .
Article 35 of the ICJ Statute envisages that the Court is to be open on a conditional basis to States which are not party to the Statute .
Appropriate conditions akin to those suggested by the Working Group in paragraph 448 would have to be imposed on States which were not party to a court &apos;s statute .
The subject-matter jurisdiction ( jurisdiction ratione materiae ) of a court
12 . In its intervention during debate on this issue in the Sixth Committee at the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly , Australia noted its general support for the approach of the Working Group in dealing with the subject-matter jurisdiction of a court .
Australia continues to support this as a basic approach which would see a court &apos;s jurisdiction based on &quot; specified existing international treaties creating crimes of an international character &quot; , including the Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind , subject to its adoption and entry into force .
The treaties themselves would obviously not be picked up in their entirety by the statute . It would be a matter of selecting the relevant crimes created by the treaties over which a court would exercise jurisdiction .
Such crimes would have to be carefully defined .
13 . The creation of such a jurisdiction , however , is not without its difficulties .
The existing treaties , apart from the Genocide Convention ( art . VI ) , which would form the basis of the jurisdiction contain no reference to States parties being given the option to submit cases to a court of the type under discussion .
A mechanism will need to be found which resolves this question .
14 . A further difficulty would arise where a party to the statute was not also a party to all the treaties forming the basis of a court &apos;s jurisdiction .
This difficulty would be resolved if there was sufficient flexibility for States to accept the jurisdiction of a court only in relation to those treaties to which they were party .
This issue also arises in addressing the question of whether States which have not accepted a court &apos;s jurisdiction in relation to offences created by treaties to which they are not party should be able to initiate complaints relating to breaches of those offences .
15 . In considering the treatment of offences under the statute , attention should also be given to the relationship between existing treaties and the draft Code of Crimes .
Australia noted in the comments it provided earlier this year on the draft Code of Crimes ( see A / CN.4 / 448 ) that , as currently drafted , the Code overlaps with and replicates definitions of offences already dealt with under existing treaties .
More particularly , in a number of cases , the Code omits elements of an existing crime or reduces its scope .
If substantive differences between the Code and existing treaties remain unresolved , the subject-matter jurisdiction of a court would not function properly .
The general question of the definition of crimes in the statute is dealt with below from paragraph 31 onwards .
16 . In paragraph 450 of the report , the Working Group notes that in relation to some treaties it may be necessary to limit the range of offences forming part of a court &apos;s subject-matter jurisdiction , so as to avoid a court being overburdened by less serious offences .
The example given concerned offences under conventions dealing with illegal trafficking in narcotic drugs .
In addressing this issue in its intervention in the Sixth Committee last year , Australia suggested that a court should have a sufficiently flexible discretion in determining whether to hear a particular case .
The issue would also arise at the time when a State elected to accept the jurisdiction of a court for particular offences .
Having accepted the jurisdiction of a court in this manner , that State would no doubt want to be certain of access to that court for trial of persons alleged to have committed offences of that kind .
To provide this certainty , offences listed in the statute would need to specify clearly the degree of seriousness attached to them ( thus justifying their coming within a court &apos;s jurisdiction ) .
17 . Australia accepts the view of the Working Group expressed in paragraph 451 of the report that , at the first phase of the establishment of a court , its jurisdiction should be limited to those crimes defined by existing treaties and should not be extended to crimes against general international law which have not been &quot; incorporated in or defined by treaties in force &quot; .
The personal jurisdiction ( jurisdiction ratione personae ) of a court
18 . The creation of the personal jurisdiction of a court is a complex task , as the Working Group acknowledges in its report .
It is a matter that requires detailed consideration .
19 . An initial hurdle is the diversity of bases for personal jurisdiction to be found in the domestic criminal law regimes of States .
Those States intending to become parties to the statute would no doubt wish to reconcile to the greatest possible extent the personal jurisdiction of a court with the equivalent jurisdiction in their domestic criminal law .
20 . A further hurdle to be overcome is the definition of the relationship between a court &apos;s personal jurisdiction and the jurisdiction bestowed on States which are parties to existing treaties to deal with persons who have committed offences created by those treaties .
This is a further aspect of the broader task of settling the relationship between the Statute and existing treaties .
21 . Australia notes that the concept of &quot; ceded jurisdiction &quot; advanced in paragraph 456 of the Working Group &apos;s report offers only a partial solution to resolving possible conflicts between a State &apos;s jurisdiction under an existing treaty and its acceptance of a court &apos;s jurisdiction .
As the Working Group notes in paragraph 456 , the device of &quot; ceded jurisdiction &quot; would not be effective where a large number of States have a jurisdictional claim under a treaty which establishes a universal jurisdiction over a particular crime .
This case would be further complicated where some States claiming jurisdiction were not parties to the statute of a court .
Such States might well consider that a State which ceded jurisdiction to an international criminal court rather than making the offender available to one of them for trial was in breach of its treaty obligations to them .
22 . In paragraph 458 , the Working Group considers the position of the national State in relation to the personal jurisdiction of a court .
Australia does not consider as a matter of principle that the consent of the national State should be necessary in every case before a court could exercise its jurisdiction to hear a case .
Australia believes there is merit in the alternative proposal put by the Working Group in paragraph 458 that a national State should only be able to prevent a court from exercising its jurisdiction when it is prepared to prosecute the offender before its own courts .
This approach presupposes that a national State could prosecute an accused person under its domestic law .
Where it could not , a national State should not be allowed to prevent an accused from being tried before an international court .
23 . In determining the role of the national State , the ILC will have to give careful consideration to the treatment of dual nationals .
There would be potential for conflicts to arise as to the handling of a dual national between the State of residence which had granted that person citizenship and the State of prior residence which still regarded the person as holding its citizenship .
The rights of respective States in such cases would need to be determined .
24 . Australia believes that finding a solution to the problems highlighted by the Working Group in its consideration of the personal jurisdiction of a court represents one of the greatest challenges in the drafting of the statute .
Any solution will need to allow parties to the statute to take account of the jurisdictional claims of other States .
The relationship between a court and the Code of Crimes
25 . Australia supports the use of separate instruments to embody the statute of a court and the Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind .
The arguments in favour of this approach are cogently set out in the Working Group &apos;s report .
Possible arrangements for the administration of a court
26 . The administrative arrangements for a court will be dictated by its structure , location and workload .
If , as has been suggested , a court would not be constituted as a full-time body , at least in the first phase of its operation , there would be a reduced administrative burden which would , in turn , require fewer staff and resources than would be needed to support a full-time body .
27 . In paragraph 470 of the report , the Working Group touches briefly on the question of where a court should sit and expresses the view that , where possible , a court should sit in the State where an offence was committed .
Australia notes that , if a court is intended to provide States parties to the statute with a forum which can deal with cases at arm &apos;s length and remove potential problems from trials , then such States may well be reluctant to have a court sit in their territory .
28 . The Working Group has outlined some of the main issues which would arise in the administration of a court .
The bulk of these issues do not require detailed consideration at this time .
Some attention should , however , be paid to the nature of a court &apos;s relationship with the United Nations .
29 . Australia notes the useful exposition in the Working Group &apos;s report of the arguments in favour of creating such a mechanism .
Australia , however , agrees with the view of the majority of the Working Group expressed in paragraph 485 of the report that these alternative mechanisms do not address the serious concerns which are at the heart of calls for an international criminal jurisdiction .
Applicable law and due process
30 . Consideration of the questions of applicable law and due process will require due attention to be paid to ensuring that the resulting provisions of the statute accord with the relevant principles of human rights instruments and United Nations standards in the field of criminal justice .
The applicable law
The definition of crimes
31 . Aspects of the question of the subject-matter jurisdiction of a court have been addressed above in paragraphs 12 to 17 .
32 . As the Working Group notes in paragraph 493 of the report , article 15 ( 1 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) embodies the principle of nullem crimen sine lege .
Article 15 ( 1 ) requires that no one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence under national or international law unless that conduct constituted an offence at the time it was committed .
The requirement for legal certainty and clarity in the definition of criminal offences , including defences and penalties , is fundamental to legality in penal matters .
Australia supports the Working Group &apos;s commitment to upholding this fundamental rule of criminal law .
33 . To observe the requirements of article 15 ( 1 ) , the Working Group argues in paragraph 493 that the jurisdiction of an international criminal court should be confined to specified crimes of an international character defined by treaties in force .
Australia &apos;s support for this basic approach was reiterated in paragraph 12 above .
It is of the greatest importance that the elements of the crimes selected be carefully defined so that the prosecutor is required to prove that the conduct of an accused person encompasses the elements of a given crime .
34 . Australia believes that , if the jurisdiction of a court is to include international crimes provided for in existing multilateral conventions , the following issues will need to be dealt with :
( a ) The inadequate definition of international crimes in existing conventions ( including the lack of reference to defences , exculpatory factors and penalties ) ;
( b ) The relationship between the draft Code of Crimes and the existing conventions ;
( c ) Typology of offences - determining which offences are the most serious and , therefore , should fall within a court &apos;s jurisdiction ;
( d ) How the Statute would confer jurisdiction over serious crimes with an international character .
( a ) Specificity
35 . Whilst existing international conventions are the most reliable source of international law from which to identify specific penal norms , existing treaties create &quot; criminal offences &quot; in a number of different ways .
36 . Some conventions proscribe the conduct and impose binding obligations on States to criminalize and punish that conduct at a national level ; others refer more generally to an issue of international concern and create obligations to take measures deemed appropriate by respective States ; and some simply create a duty to punish or extradite an alleged offender or cooperate in the prosecution and punishment of certain conduct .
37 . Consideration will need to be given as to how specific offences which constitute a serious crime of an international character are to be deduced from the wide range of penal norms created by existing conventions .
The elements of the criteria by which certain conduct defined in existing conventions would come within the jurisdiction of a court will need to be identified .
38 . In general , it is Australian legal practice at both a federal and state level to specifically identify the constituent elements of a criminal offence , as well as defences , exculpatory factors and penalties .
Australia is of the view that , despite reliance on existing conventions which define penal norms , the vagueness which characterizes some provisions has the potential to create difficulties in meeting the requirements of article 15 ( 1 ) of the ICCPR .
( b ) Relationship between the draft Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind and existing multilateral conventions
39 . As noted above in paragraph 15 , Australia expressed concern in its comments on the draft Code of Crimes that the Code overlaps and replicates definitions of offences already dealt with under other multilateral conventions , as well as in some cases omitting elements of existing crimes or reducing their scope .
40 . If a Court is to derive jurisdiction from multilateral conventions other than the Code , the relationship between these conventions and the Code must be clarified .
( c ) Typology of offences
41 . Australia agrees with the Working Group &apos;s recommendation that an international criminal court should be confined to dealing with crimes which are genuinely of an international character .
42 . The question arises as to what criteria should be used to determine which offences are to be regarded as :
( i ) Of a genuinely international character ; and
( ii ) Serious enough to warrant inclusion in the jurisdiction of a court .
43 . Is the identification of a crime as &quot; genuinely of an international character &quot; sufficient for inclusion ?
44 . Should jurisdiction ultimately depend on the gravity of the offence committed ?
Some crimes , such as terrorism , must be regarded as inherently serious .
45 . Australia is of the view that these questions need clarification to ensure that objective criteria are relied upon in determining which offences should be within a court &apos;s jurisdiction .
46 . Australia also notes that there are variations between treaties establishing international crimes in their treatment of the definition of such crimes .
These variations can make it difficult to attribute a particular weight or indication as to the seriousness of an offence based on the way in which that conduct is defined in a given instrument .
( d ) Provision conferring jurisdiction
47 . The question of specificity overlaps with the question of how the statute is to confer jurisdiction on a court .
The statute will require a provision or provisions which confer jurisdiction over international crimes .
Such a provision or provisions will have an important role to play in ensuring that the statute meets the requirements of article 15 ( 1 ) of the ICCPR .
The general rules of criminal law
48 . In paragraph 495 of the report , the Working Group notes that most treaties are silent about defences and extenuating circumstances and that no rules of international criminal law on these matters have evolved .
In paragraph 496 , the Working Group suggests that a court could have recourse to national law .
As the Working Group notes , however , national law is in principle only a question of fact at the international level .
Two options for dealing with this problem are explored .
The first is to refer directly to the application of domestic law where appropriate .
The second is to require dual criminality ( by residence or place where the act was carried out ) and thereby refer to national law indirectly .
49 . Australia appreciates that the main concern of the Working Group was to identify sources of applicable law .
If the jurisdiction of a court is to run concurrently with that of national courts ( as opposed to exclusively ) , there is a certain preliminary logic in filling the gaps of international criminal law by recourse to domestic law .
Australia believes , however , that on balance this approach will inevitably lead to inconsistencies in treatment across cases and thus create more problems than it solves .
Defences and mitigating circumstances available will depend on the nationality and / or the place where a crime is committed .
Such inconsistency is not desirable and may undermine the legitimacy of a court .
The application of the domestic laws of different countries from case to case would also impose a major burden on the judges of a court who could not be expected to have a detailed knowledge of all such laws .
Applicable procedure
50 . Australia agrees with the view of the Working Group expressed in paragraph 500 of the report that the statute of a court or rules thereunder should specify to the greatest extent possible the procedural rules for trials .
The Working Group also indicates that it may be necessary for a court to regulate its own procedure in cases not covered by the statute or rules , by drawing on the principles common to the codes of procedure of the States parties .
51 . Whilst Australia agrees that the principle of nullem crimen sine lege does not prevent this course of action because that principle is concerned with substantive as opposed to procedural law , the application of different procedural rules again raises the issue of inconsistency .
52 . To overcome the potential problem of inconsistency , a unified set of rules would need to be applied whatever the national origin of the accused .
Questions of procedure and , in particular , rules of evidence are not just technical matters but ( as the United Kingdom delegation pointed out in its intervention on this subject in the Sixth Committee at the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly ) are central to ensuring a fair trial .
These issues vary across legal systems and in Australia &apos;s opinion require detailed analysis .
The penalties to be imposed
53 . Australia notes that few conventions define penalties .
In paragraph 502 of the report , the Working Group suggested that the statute will need a penalties provision or a court would have to base the penalty on national law or on &quot; principles common to all nations &quot; .
As stated in paragraph 32 above , Australia believes that the starting-point in considering the question of penalties must be article 15 ( 1 ) of the ICCPR which embodies the principle of nulla poena sine lege .
This requires &quot; clarity and certainty &quot; in penalty provisions .
Australia agrees with the view of the Working Group that recourse to national law or &quot; principles common to all nations &quot; may well not meet the requirements of clarity and certainty .
It would , therefore , appear necessary for penalty provisions to be developed for the statute .
54 . The Working Group recommended the inclusion of a residual provision in the statute to deal with penalties in the event that no penalty is specified in a treaty or if a specified penalty fell outside the jurisdiction of an international court .
Australia is also of the opinion that the inclusion of a residual penalty provision which was not sufficiently detailed would not necessarily cure the problem and discharge the obligation under article 15 ( 1 ) of the ICCPR .
If , however , the statute contains penalty provisions , no residual provision would be required .
Ensuring due process
55 . In paragraph 503 of the report , the Working Group refers to article 14 of the ICCPR as the primary source of international law on the question of due process without further elaboration .
Australia believes , however , that there are a number of issues which need consideration .
( a ) Review / Appeal
56 . Article 14 ( 5 ) provides that everyone convicted of a crime shall have the right to have his conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law .
This suggests that in the statute of a court there would need to be provision for the review of conviction and sentence by an appellate tribunal , e.g. , a full bench of a court .
The appellate bench should have the discretion to grant or refuse leave to appeal .
( b ) Trial by jury
57 . As in other common-law countries , trial by jury is a fundamental element of Australia &apos;s legal system .
Section 80 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia guarantees a right for a person charged with an indictable offence under any law of the Commonwealth to be tried by a jury .
Australia is not advocating that the statute make provision for trial by jury .
It wishes , however , to draw to the attention of the ILC the possible constitutional difficulties Australia and other countries may need to address if they are to accept the jurisdiction of an international court .
58 . The problem is highlighted where international instruments create a binding obligation on States parties to criminalize certain conduct under domestic law as a serious ( indictable ) offence .
For example , article 2 of the 1970 Hague Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft requires each State party to make the offence &quot; punishable by severe penalties &quot; .
The Crimes ( Aviation ) Act 1991 implements Australia &apos;s obligations under the hijacking conventions .
A person charged with that offence , therefore , would have the right to trial by jury .
Prosecution and related matters
The system of prosecution 59 . In paragraph 509 of the report , the Working Group recommends an ad hoc independent prosecutorial system .
Australia agrees that an independent prosecutorial system is preferable to complainant States conducting the prosecution .
Ensuring independence and impartiality in the prosecutorial system is an essential underpinning to the credibility and legitimacy of a court .
60 . The Working Group &apos;s suggestion that a court appoint the prosecutor after consultation with the States concerned is sensible in that it would preserve the independence of the prosecutorial system while giving the States concerned an opportunity to be involved .
It will be necessary , however , to precisely identify which States parties should be involved in the process of consultation with a court .
The exact standing of the States parties in the process of selection and appointment of the prosecutor would have to be made clear .
The initiation of a case
61 . In paragraph 512 of the report , the Working Group suggests that adopting the system of appointing an independent prosecutor would obviate the need for a preliminary hearing to test the evidence as a court could dismiss &quot; frivolous or unsubstantiated charges &quot; .
An additional consideration is that preliminary hearings before a court could well be regarded as unnecessarily time-consuming and expensive .
62 . Australia believes that the role , function and duties of a prosecutor should be regulated .
Questions of ethics ; a prosecutor &apos;s duty to a court ; and obligations towards the defence are the types of issues that need to be addressed .
63 . The exercise of prosecutorial discretion and the criteria for prosecution decisions also need to be regulated .
64 . Australia agrees with the Working Group &apos;s suggestion made in paragraph 511 that there should be scope for review of a prosecutor &apos;s decision not to prosecute .
65 . In the absence of a permanent independent prosecutorial office , a case could only be brought before a court on complaint from a State party or the Security Council .
Australia agrees with the view of the Working Group expressed in paragraph 514 that the power of complaint should extend to any State party which has accepted the jurisdiction of a court with respect to the offence in question .
A difficulty would arise where a State party which wished to initiate a complaint in relation to a number of offences had not accepted the jurisdiction of a court in relation to all those offences .
This situation will need to be addressed .
Bringing defendants before a court
66 . The creation of mechanisms to bring defendants befort a court presents many difficult questions , which must be resolved if a court is to operate effectively .
The Working Group has explored a number of these questions in its report .
The differing constitutional requirements of States will be one of the major hurdles to be overcome .
67 . Australia agrees with the view of the Working Group expressed in paragraph 525 of the report that the statute of a court would have to establish minimum requirements for the transfer of alleged offenders , which would have to be observed by States parties .
In drafting these requirements , the Working Group should draw upon existing extradition arrangements between States .
The use of these arrangements as a foundation should result in a set of draft provisions that are more recognizable to States .
Conceptual problems , however , may arise over the need for an alleged offender to be extradited to a court rather than a State .
68 . In paragraph 527 , the Working Group deals with what it would regard as some of the basic elements of a request for transfer , including the existence of evidence which would have to be &quot; prima facie sufficient to justify putting the accused on trial &quot; .
Australia believes there would be difficulties in this approach .
The reference to prima facie evidence would mean different things to different States .
Moreover , it is not a universal standard in extradition treaties , many of which adopt a &quot; no evidence &quot; approach whereby the requesting State is only required to provide a statment of the acts or omissions which are alleged against the person sought to the requesting State .
69 . As well as considering how an accused person should be brought before a court , Australia believes that attention should also be given to the conditions in which accused persons would be held prior to trial .
In this regard , the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment should be used as the basic standard .
70 . To the extent that offenders may be juveniles , the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice and articles 37 and 40 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child should be used as the minimum standard .
71 . Paragraphs 528 to 545 of the report usefully explore the issues relating to assistance from States in support of the prosecution of alleged offenders before an international court .
Such assistance could well be crucial to the successful prosecution of alleged offenders .
Assistance would no doubt be required from a number of countries in complex cases .
72 . In paragraph 528 , the Working Group notes that assistance would be &quot; &apos; one-way &apos; assistance to the court rather than reciprocal assistance &quot; .
The Working Group is right to point out that assistance would be &quot; one-way &quot; .
The question arises , however , as to whether such assistance should be directed to a court .
Where mutual assistance agreements and arrangements are established between States , the purpose of assistance sought is for the most part directed towards preparation of the prosecution &apos;s case against an alleged offender .
Requests for assistance , therefore , are generated by the prosecuting authorities of a requesting State .
By the same token , it would be the independent prosecutor who would most likely need to call for the assistance of States in the preparation of cases to be brought before a court .
A court which is to hear a case should not be involved nor seem to be involved in the preparation of the prosecution &apos;s case .
To maintain this separation , assistance from States should be provided directly to the prosecutor .
73 . Consideration will also need to be given as to what assistance should be provided to the legal representatives of an alleged offender to ensure that they can prepare a proper defence .
The question of financial assistance to defendants unable to fund their defence also needs to be considered .
The lack of financial means in such cases could deny a defendant proper representation .
The minimum guarantees in relation to a person &apos;s right to legal assistance are set down in article 14.3 ( d ) of the ICCPR .
74 . In paragraph 531 , the Working Group suggests there are three options in relation to international judicial assistance .
After assessing these options , the Working Group suggests that the best option for assistance , at least in the first phase of a court &apos;s operation , would be a general provision in the statute supplemented by a non-exclusive list of the types of assistance which may be sought from States parties .
The possibility of a mutual assistance treaty between States parties could then be addressed at a later time .
Australia accepts the reasoning behind this assessment .
It would stress , however , the fundamental requirement of establishing an effective assistance regime if successful prosecutions are to take place .
Implementation of sentences
75 . Australia regards the implementation of sentences to be one of the most difficult questions to be addressed .
There are a number of issues to be taken into consideration .
( a ) Humanitarian considerations
76 . First , a term of imprisonment should not be served under conditions less favourable than those provided in the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners .
77 . Secondly , even where the imprisonment of an offender is implemented in a State which complies with those standards , the differences in language , climate and culture may still contribute to difficult conditions of imprisonment .
( b ) States
78 . There needs to be flexibility in determining which State is to take responsibility for carrying out the sentence .
The extent of this responsibility will need to be established , including such matters as the cost of imprisonment .
( c ) Transfer of prisoner to national State
79 . A number of countries have concluded mutual repatriation agreements in relation to citizens of one party convicted and sentenced in the courts of the other .
Australia suggests that consideration be given to including a provision in the draft statute allowing the national State of a convicted offender to implement the sentence , if it so wishes .
There are two qualifications to that view .
First , a court should be satisfied that the State has a facility which meets the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners .
Secondly , there needs to be consideration given to whether the consent of the prisoner should be a prerequisite to granting custody to the national State .
80 . If transfer of prisoners is to be permitted , there need to be provisions dealing with proceedings to determine applications for transfers ; lawful custody of a prisoner in transit ; transfer in the custody of an escort ; and so on .
81 . Guidance on the handling of the transfer of prisoners might be obtained from the Model Agreement on the Transfer of Prisoners and the Model Treaty on the Transfer of Supervision of Offenders Conditionally Sentenced or Conditionally Released .
Review of sentences
82 . Australia agrees with the view of the Working Group expressed in paragraph 546 of the report that consideration should be given to providing for applications to vary sentences .
A system of parole , reductions and remissions would need to be considered .
Relationship of a court to the existing extradition system
83 . In paragraph 552 of the report , the Working Group correctly raises the issue of the relationship between treaties which adopt the aut dedere aut judicare approach and the jurisdiction of an international court .
84 . It is possible that a State party to the statute which elects to use the jurisdiction of an international court may be regarded as in breach of its obligation to prosecute under another treaty where a State to whom extradition has been refused under that treaty does not recognize the jurisdiction of an international court .
85 . Australia supports the suggestion in paragraph 553 that the system for handing over accused persons be complementary to the existing prosecute-or-extradite regime .
To achieve maximum flexibility and facilitate the widest possible support for a court , States parties which have accepted the jurisdiction of the court in respect of a given offence should have an option to surrender to an international court as a third alternative .
Imposing an obligation to hand over an accused person for trial on States that are willing to accept the jurisdiction of a court may deter some States from becoming parties to the statute .
86 . In the light of the particular problems arising from the existence of entirely separate treaty regimes , Australia believes that the issue of multiple requests for the extradition of an alleged offender being received by a State party to the statute needs detailed consideration .
DENMARK
( See Norway )
FINLAND
ICELAND
ITALY
1 . In the opinion of the Italian Government , the court should have general jurisdiction and be universal in character .
In fact , as in any domestic legal system the criminal jurisdiction would not be credible if it was not made applicable to all citizens ; also , the jurisdiction of an international court would lose credibility if its application differed in each region or with regard to other types of aggregations .
Therefore , Italy is not in favour of the establishment of various regional tribunals , which would not be apt to guarantee the observance of the fundamental principle of equality in the treatment of the accused persons within the proceedings .
2 . As for the formation of the judgement organ , due account should be taken , in each case , of the characteristics of the crimes to be judged , in order to ensure that the specific circumstances associated with the facts that are relevant for the proceedings are better understood .
Therefore , the judgement organ should include persons who are in the position to understand and evaluate such characteristics .
3 . The convention establishing the court should grant all States ( including , as the case may be , also non-contracting States ) the right to designate persons having the qualifications of competence and impartiality that are required for the participation in the judgement organs appointed for the various cases to be examined .
Moreover , the general assembly of the designated judges ( or the assembly of the contracting States ) should elect the President of the court and the bureau , who will appoint the judgement organ by selecting the names from the general list prepared in accordance with the aforementioned principles and bearing in mind the model provided by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe ( CSCE ) Stockholm Convention on conciliation and arbitration .
At the same time , the seat of the judicial body must be located in a place which gives the most ample guarantees of independence and freedom of judgement .
Such location could also be different from the official seat of the court , which could be better established in one of the seats of the United Nations , in order to facilitate as much as possible the activity of the new institution in relation to the rules on privileges and immunities .
4 . The statute of the court should be independent from the Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind , whose provisions may in fact include crimes that are not subject to the jurisdiction of the international court .
The Code of Crimes must certainly be defined in the most appropriate form ( either a convention or another type of instrument ) and , once defined , will provide substantial guidance for the court .
But the statute of the court must remain , none the less , independent from the Code .
5 . The structure of the court must include , first of all , a prosecuting authority competent for instructing each case on the basis of the evidence collected following the &quot; notitiae criminis &quot; or the elements that any person may give to the court ; secondly , an organ for the decision of the case ; and , thirdly , an organ for the appeal .
6 . On the jurisdiction of the court , it is the view of the Italian Government that such jurisdiction must be extended to all crimes listed by the Conventions having a universal character .
For example , one may recall the war crimes against the peace or mankind considered by the Geneva Conventions and Protocols , the Genocide Convention , the Conventions of the United Nations and of the specialized agencies against terrorism , the Convention on the special protection of diplomats , the Convention on the taking of hostages , etc . The list should remain open in order to allow reference to other conventions whose acceptance becomes gradually more universal .
When doubts arise in this respect , the court should be authorized to issue a &quot; preliminary ruling &quot; which could be linked to the point of the acceptance of jurisdiction .
In any event , the intervention of the Security Council should be excluded .
Here it would be impossible to preclude the intervention of the Security Council aimed at establishing whether or not an aggression took place in a given situation .
But , once such a decision is taken , the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court must be kept free from any political influence .
7 . The jurisdiction of the court must concern the individuals .
The fact that an individual is vested with the quality of organ of a State must be declared irrelevant and it must be stated that the rules on immunities do not apply in this case .
On the contrary , the State as such must not be subject to the jurisdiction of the court .
It could be acceptable that the jurisdiction of the court ratione loci ( i.e. , relating to the events which had occurred within the territory of a State ) is made the object of a possible declaration of acceptance .
Conversely , no limits could be admitted as regards the jurisdiction rationae personarum or ratione materiae , except for those provided for by the convention establishing the court .
Furthermore , one may also accept that the jurisdiction of the court concurs with the national jurisdiction , if the latter is in fact exercised .
However , a certain prejudice in favour of the court &apos;s jurisdiction should result from the rules of the constituent convention .
The faculty must also be granted to the Security Council to disqualify a national jurisdiction , even if only temporarily , whenever it is deemed that such jurisdiction does not possess the requisites of impartiality universally considered necessary for the conduct of the proceedings .
8 . All the provisions internationally recognized and concerning the inapplicability of causes of exclusion of criminal responsibility such as the superior &apos;s order , the lack of knowledge of the act by the subordinate , etc . , must be reproduced in the statute . To this end , it is suggested that , in drafting the statute of the court , the content of part I of the draft Code of Crimes , which considers the general principles of criminal responsibility and punishment , is largely used as a model .
9 . On the question of trials in absentia , Italy has some doubts on the need to admit these types of proceedings .
10 . The statute of the court must also accurately specify , on the basis of the existing rules of international law , the procedural guarantees provided in favour of the accused persons .
11 . Finally , the court must impose penalties and determine where its sentences will be executed .
At the same time , if the court is given the authority to decide on the indemnification of the victims of crimes and the right to be indemnified is recognized by the court to a victim , different mechanisms ( resulting , for example , from the establishment of special funds ) could also come into play to resolve issues such as the amount of compensation , the identification of the debtor and the implementation of the court &apos;s decision .
12 . The execution of the sentences of the court must take place under the control of the United Nations in order to prevent the granting of undue amnesties or pardons .
MEXICO
&#91; Original : Spanish &#93;
&#91; 5 May 1993 &#93;
The draft under consideration constitutes a distinctly novel initiative .
The international community does not yet have experience in the establishment of permanent international criminal courts .
The only existing precedents , the Tokyo and Nürnberg Tribunals , were the product of special circumstances having been created by Powers which had emerged victorious from armed conflicts of great magnitude ; they cannot , therefore , serve as a precedent for a notion such as the one with which we are now concerned .
In the light of recent experience with regard to the establishment of a war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia , and the role which the United Nations plays in the maintenance of international peace and security , some countries have proposed the establishment of an international criminal court within the framework of , and closely linked to , the Organization .
The absence of provisions in the Charter of the United Nations regarding the establishment of bodies of this type , and the fact that the Organization is based on the principles of the legal equality of States , the self-determination of peoples and non-intervention in the internal affairs of States , prompts us to suggest that the creation of an international criminal court is feasible only with the express consent of States , as embodied in an international treaty , and only to the extent to which States are willing to be bound by its provisions .
Until now , it has been an internationally accepted general rule that the criminal courts of States are the normal and natural bodies with jurisdiction to try individuals who commit crimes .
Transferring that obligation to a supranational body may not only have direct effects in the area of territorial sovereignty , but may also conflict with the constitutional basis of some States .
The tremendous differences that exist among the various penal systems constitute a further obstacle to the notion of an international jurisdiction .
Not all systems agree , for example , on such concepts as capacity , penalties , legality , and so on , as is clear from the discussions held in the various forums in which the notion has been raised .
In its report ( A / 47 / 10 , annex ) , the Working Group on the question of an international criminal jurisdiction , recognizing the obstacles confronting an initiative of such magnitude , has proposed the establishment , by a Statute in the form of a treaty , of an ad hoc mechanism , having optional jurisdiction , in the first instance only , to be exercised , in the first phase of its operations , only over private persons ( without prejudging State responsibility , when appropriate ) .
Despite the flexibility of the mechanism proposed by the Working Group , the close link that exists between the proposed international criminal court and the draft Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind - which , if adopted , will be applied and interpreted by that court - adds a number of difficulties to those that already exist ; it requires the study of such questions as the principles of non-retroactivity and of legality of the crime , penalties , prescription of the public right of action , and so on , which in the terms proposed , conflict in almost every case with the principles on which the various penal systems in the world are based .
For example , the draft Code seeks to establish the non-applicability of statutory limitations to international crimes , whereas the majority of national codes have so far provided for such limitations ; it also envisages referring to other bodies of law in connection with such sensitive issues as penalties , when , in fact , penalties constitute an essential element of these types of norms .
Furthermore , some questions which play an important role in the decision to establish an international criminal court - questions relating to the establishment of an international prison system which can guarantee the implementation of the penalties imposed by the court or a similar mechanism ; verification of the implementation of such penalties by the judicial body which imposes them ; the handing over of alleged perpetrators of international crimes by the States which have custody of them ; and the establishment of a prosecutorial organ responsible for instituting criminal proceedings - have yet to be clarified .
In the specific case of Mexico , acceptance of an international criminal jurisdiction would appear extremely doubtful in the light of our domestic legal system , under which imposition of penalties is the exclusive prerogative of the judicial authorities , and therefore of the Mexican courts ( arts . 21 , 103 and 104 of our Political Constitution ) .
While the State &apos;s monopoly on criminal proceedings could be compatible with the notion of optional and concurrent jurisdiction , the nature of the jurisdictional mechanism proposed could lead to its being connected with a special court ; this would conflict with the provisions of articles 13 and 14 of the Constitution .
The exceptions envisaged by the draft to the principle non bis in idem , which permit double jeopardy in circumstances that are by no means clear , and the international nature of the court , which makes it necessary to rely on general principles of law and to consider referring to other bodies of legislation in respect of situations not provided for in the Statute ( as the Working Group acknowledges in its report ) , conflict with the guarantees of legal safeguards afforded by our system of law , especially criminal law , in which norms are strictly applied and analogies are tightly restricted .
Moreover , the fact that a number of international instruments do not envisage the penalties to be imposed for crimes of an international character , but simply provide that States have an obligation to prevent and suppress them , indicates that the norms have not been properly incorporated .
In order for a penal norm to meet constitutional requirements , it must consist of a rule ( a description of the offence ) and must envisage a punishment .
According to the principle nullum crimen sine lege , nulla poena sine lege , which is the basis of our legal system , absence of a punishment constitutes an impediment to the application of the norm ( no agreement has been reached on the penalties to be included in the draft Code , although it has been decided that their inclusion is absolutely necessary ) .
In its report , the Working Group supports the view that the court should have jurisdiction over crimes committed prior to its establishment , provided that the offences in question are crimes of an international character defined by treaties in force at the time when they were committed .
That argument , in the Group &apos;s opinion , is rooted in the notion that a retrospective change in proceedings in no way affects the principle of non-retroactivity .
We consider such an approach to be unreasonable .
Aside from the fact that article 14 of our Constitution provides that no person shall be deprived of rights without a trial held before a pre-existing court , in accordance with laws enacted prior to the commission of the offence , the existence of an international treaty which envisages some crime of this type is not in itself sufficient to confer on the court automatic jurisdiction to try and punish the crime , especially if such an instrument recognizes that the national courts of States have the power and the obligation to suppress such offences .
One of the more sensitive issues relates to the handing over of alleged perpetrators to the international court . Under the assumption that an international court is not a foreign court , the Working Group favours the immediate handing over of the accused , without need for an extradition proceeding , which is questionable .
While it is true that an international court would not be a foreign court , it would not be a domestic court , either ; for purposes of handing over an accused person , it would have to be equated with a foreign court and , accordingly , it would be necessary to guarantee that the accused was able to fully exercise his right by the competent national authorities in an extradition proceeding .
New difficulties emerge in this connection .
In the first place , in accordance with practice , the handing over of citizens is subject to the discretion of the federal executive authorities ; secondly , the Mexican Act on International Extradition ( which would be the applicable law , initially at least ) , establishes specific requirements for acceding to an extradition request ( arts . 7 , 8 , 9 and 10 , inter alia ) , which conflict with the principles on which an international court would be based , one example being the rule that , where the right of action in respect of the offence in question is time-barred under Mexican criminal law , the extradition request is inadmissible .
There are still a number of ambiguities in the report of the Working Group which would benefit from more thorough analysis , inter alia , those relating to the establishment of a Prosecutor &apos;s Office and to the prison system .
However , since the Working Group has given preliminary consideration to them , we will refrain from commenting on them until such time as further information is available .
Currently , the Mexican legal system is incompatible with the establishment of an international criminal jurisdiction .
Nevertheless , we suggest that , in the discussion of the topic , careful consideration be given to the following :
- The nature of the rendering of criminal justice and the close link between that and the exercise of State sovereignty .
Whatever jurisdictional mechanism is finally adopted should reflect maximum respect for the territorial jurisdiction of the judicial organs of individual States , and should have the latter &apos;s express consent ;
- The need to guarantee the total independence of the jurisdictional body , if and when it is established , and the impartiality of its judges .
Several States have expressed support for a special agreement linking the court to the United Nations system .
Although that proposal is logical , in view of the forum in which the concept has been developed , the types of crimes over which the court would have jurisdiction ( aggression , threat of aggression , systematic human rights violations , and so on ) make it especially vulnerable to political fluctuations .
A court whose decisions in respect of specific crimes could be overruled by the Security Council could diminish confidence in the international community ;
- The need to ensure that the Statute which governs the functioning of the court is drafted in such a way as to envisage specifically each of the cases in which penal norms would be applied , so as to leave little or no room for referral and the application of other additional legislation ;
- The fact that rules and punishments constitute basic elements of penal norms which is , moreover , expressed in the universally accepted principle nullum crimen sine lege , nulla poena sine lege , must be reflected in the statute of any court which applies the law .
- The retroactive application of law , the question of whether statutory limitations should , in fact , apply to crimes deemed to be of an international character , as has been the case , up to now , under the legal systems of many countries , and the notion of permitting double jeopardy are some of the sensitive issues which must be clarified before further steps are taken towards the establishment of a court .
A jurisdictional body should , in principle , try only offences committed following its establishment , and should apply the laws that were in force at the time when the offence was committed ;
- The definition of the arrangements for the handing over of alleged perpetrators to the court .
Respect for the right of all persons to a hearing , to due process and to legal safeguards requires the proper observance of extradition treaties and recognition of them as the sole mechanism for handing persons accused of committing an offence over to foreign courts .
Lastly , until such time as the international conditions required for the establishment of an international criminal jurisdiction are generated , and further progress is made in the progressive development of the law of nations , emphasis should be given to strengthening both national institutions and States to international judicial assistance , as the sole viable alternative means for States to combat crime .

&#91; 27 April 1993 &#93;
The Nordic countries welcome resolution 47 / 33 adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations at its forty-seventh session requesting the International Law Commission to continue its work on the question of an international criminal jurisdiction by undertaking the project for the elaboration of a draft statute for an international criminal court .
The International Law Commission should consider this project as a matter of priority during its forthcoming session .
The ideal outcome would be for the Commission to draw up a draft statute which could be submitted to the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly .
In order to make this possible , consideration should be given to whether certain questions of detail could be clarified at a later stage , e.g. , during the Commission &apos;s second review of the statute .
One such question would , for example , be the composition of the court .
The same applies to the question of the implementation of sentences , which should be given closer consideration .
On the other hand , it may seem expedient and necessary for the Commission to devote more attention to procedural questions than to substantive matters such as describing offences and determining sentences .
A number of detailed proposals for procedural provisions have already been forwarded to the Security Council under its resolution 808 ( 1993 ) .
The Nordic countries would also emphasize that the question of an international criminal court must be viewed separately from that of a Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind .
Many basic international crimes have already found expression in existing and generally accepted treaty law , and the effective implementation through , inter alia , the establishment of an international criminal court should not await the finalization of the draft Code , a project that may take considerably more time than drafting a statute for a court .
Although the Nordic countries support the idea of establishing a permanent court through an international convention , they are at the same time of the view that the establishment of such a court should be based on an evolutionary approach .
This implies , for example , that the court , at least in its initial phase and until a clear idea is obtained of how much it would be used , should not be a full-time body , but rather an established structure which can be called into operation when required .
The Nordic countries endorse the suggestion in the report of the Commission &apos;s Working Group that by becoming a party to the statute , a State would only accept certain administrative obligations .
The States parties should accept the court &apos;s jurisdiction by making a declaration to this effect , analogous to acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice .
States that are not party to the statute should , in conformity with the two-step process described in paragraph 444 of the report of the Working Group , also be given an opportunity to declare their acceptance of the court &apos;s jurisdiction on an ad hoc basis .
As regards the subject-matter jurisdiction ( jurisdiction ratione materiae ) of a court , this should be based on international conventions , such as the Geneva Conventions and Protocols and a prospective Code of Crimes , rather than on national legislation .
Particularly in a long-term perspective , the use of national legislation could pose certain problems , e.g. , as regards which acts are defined as offences in the legislation of the various countries , descriptions of offences , determining sentences , etc .
The offences within the jurisdiction of the court should be limited to serious crimes against mankind such as war crimes , be they committed by high military commanders or soldiers in the battlefield .
On the other hand , there is a great need for a more precise definition of war crimes as well as the concept &quot; serious offence &quot; .
As regards the personal jurisdiction ( jurisdiction ratione personae ) of a court , the consent of the State of which the accused is a national should not be required .
Nor should the consent of the State where the offence was committed be required unless the perpetrator is under the jurisdiction of that State .
Generally speaking , the jurisdiction of a court should be very wide ; if the consent of the various States involved is required , this could easily impair the effectiveness of such a court .
Reference is also made to the statement made by Norway on behalf of the Nordic countries in the Sixth Committee on 27 October 1992 during the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly .

GE.92-14435 ( E )
The meeting was called to order at 11.40 a.m.
CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS SUBMITTED BY STATES PARTIES UNDER ARTICLE 19 OF THE CONVENTION ( agenda item 4 ) ( continued )
1 . At the invitation of the Chairman , Mr. Lanus and Mr. Paz ( Argentina ) took places at the Committee table .
2 . Mr. LANUS ( Argentina ) , replying to questions asked by the members of the Committee , said that the families and relatives of persons who had disappeared before 10 December 1983 , when the new democratic Government had taken power , received tax-exempt pensions once their claims had been made to and approved by a competent court .
Those entitled were children under the age of 21 , the spouse and other family members who had lived in the same household as the disappeared person .
To date , 5,000 persons had received such pensions .
Pensioners also benefited from social services .
In addition , Act No. 23,852 of 1990 , supplemented by Act No. 17,531 , provided that persons whose fathers or brothers had disappeared before 10 December 1983 could request exemption from compulsory military service .
To date , 400 such requests had been made .
3 . Under Decree No. 70 / 91 , a compensation scheme had been set up for persons who had been held at the disposal of the National Executive ( PEN ) prior to the restoration of democracy .
The Decree stated that any persons who had been placed at the disposal of the National Executive before 10 December 1983 , by its decision , and any civilians who had been detained on the orders of the military courts , whether or not they had initiated proceedings for damages , could claim the benefits of the Decree , provided that they had not received any compensation as a result of a court judgement in connection with the acts referred to therein .
If such persons were civilians , they must have been deprived of their freedom on the orders of the military courts , whether or not they had been convicted in the courts .
Compensation amounted to approximately $ 10,000 per year of detention .
The Ministry of the Interior had informed him that all channels for compensation claims had been opened to persons who had been victims of unlawful repression .
He apologized for the fact that the report lacked information on disappeared persons .
4 . Mr. SORENSEN thanked the Argentine delegation for the information it had provided with regard to doctors and noted that unfortunately doctors participated in more than 60 per cent of torture cases in all parts of the world .
Danish film requested by the Argentine delegation would be sent to the Danish Embassy in Switzerland and then forwarded to the Argentine Mission .
5 . Mr. LANUS ( Argentina ) said that he would send the film to Buenos Aires , where the Ministry of the Interior could investigate the allegations and try to establish the identities of the doctors involved .
He promised to keep the Committee informed .
6 . Mr. LORENZO ( Country Rapporteur ) informed the Argentine delegation that the Committee &apos;s conclusions at the end of its consideration of Argentina &apos;s supplementary report had been completely reformulated and had been adopted by consensus .
7 . Mr. BEN AMMAR ( Alternate Country Rapporteur ) said that the conclusions read :
&quot; The Committee thanks the Government of the Republic of Argentina for having submitted its first periodic report within the time period stipulated in article 19 of the Convention and for the information and clarifications kindly provided by the delegation to the Committee .
The Committee expresses its appreciation for the efforts made to improve the situation with respect to human rights , in particular in the area of laws which relate to the purposes of the Convention against Torture .
Despite the aforementioned efforts , however , the Committee expresses its deep concern at the continuing vestiges of the former regime and the disturbing use of violent methods and of torture in many cases , as well as the clemency and impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of such acts contrary to the requirements of the Convention .
The Committee expresses the hope that the Government of the Republic of Argentina will redouble its efforts to take all legislative , judicial , administrative and other measures which will be sufficiently effective to halt and to prevent the practice of torture and of all cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and , where necessary , to punish the perpetrators of such acts .
The Committee further expresses the hope that the Government will submit to it as soon as possible the additional information requested by its members and thanks it in advance for its cooperation . &quot;
8 . Mr. LANUS ( Argentina ) thanked the members of the Committee for the interest with which they had received the report , its oral introduction and the replies to questions and for the understanding with which they had considered Argentina &apos;s efforts to eradicate once and for all antisocial practices that were contrary to human dignity and human rights .
9 . Mr. Lanus and Mr. Paz ( Argentina ) withdrew .
ORGANIZATIONAL AND OTHER MATTERS ( agenda item 2 ) ( continued )
10 . The CHAIRMAN said that the Mexican delegation had asked to have its replies to the Committee &apos;s questions postponed until Thursday , 19 November .
11 . It was so decided .
12 . The CHAIRMAN said that Mr. Mikhailov had volunteered to act as alternate country rapporteur for the report of Germany .
13 . He informed the Committee that copies of the film &quot; Raison d &apos;état &quot; were available .
The film was in french with English subtitles .
Spanish subtitles would be provided at a later date .
14 . Mr. SORENSEN said that the film entitled &quot; In spite of &quot; which he had shown the previous year , would be available to all members of the Committee free of charge in English , French , Spanish , German , Italian , Danish and Swedish .
Report by the Chairman on the outcome of the Meeting of Chairpersons of Human Rights Treaty Bodies
15 . The CHAIRMAN said that the meeting of the Chairpersons of human rights treaty bodies met every two years .
The fourth session had been held from 12 to 16 October 1992 .
Six Chairpersons had been present , plus one member of the Group of Three established under the International Covenant on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid .
They had discussed the problem of reports which were either not submitted at all or were submitted late .
Since the Committee against Torture was relatively new , it did not yet have that problem , but it might at a later date .
He therefore suggested that the Committee should maintain contact with States parties which had not submitted their reports , warning them that , if they did not do so promptly , it would still discuss the situaiton with regard to torture in their territories on the basis of information from other sources .
Perhaps the Committee should actually adopt that apparoach because at least two States which had been due to submit their reports in 1988 had still not done so .
16 . It had also been pointed out in the meeting of Chairpersons that it would be helpful to explain to States parties how to prepare and submit reports .
A UNITAR guidebook did exist , but it was available only in English and Chinese , although it was to be made available in other languages as well .
The proposal made four years previously that States should be invited to submit only one report which would cover all aspects of human rights and then be divided up by the Secretariat , with the relevant sections being transmitted to the Committee concerned , might also be worth discussing again .
17 . The Chairpersons had noted that many Committees were behind in their consideration of reports .
That was irrelevant for the Committee against Torture , which had not encountered that problem .
18 . Another matter raised by the Chairpersons was that many countries had only signed one or two international instruments .
The system of international conventions formed a whole and States must therefore be encouraged to sign them all .
19 . Another question had related to the financial situation .
Most Committees were financed by the United Nations budget , but the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ( CERD ) and the Committee against Torture had separate budgets , funded in part by States parties in the case of CERD and entirely in the case of the Committee against Torture .
There was always a risk of a shortfall if States parties did not make their contributions .
In that context , the proposal by Australia that the Committee should be funded from the regular United Nations budget had been unanimously supported by all the States parties to the Convention against Torture .
20 . In a discussion of Secretariat services , the Chairpersons had noted that , while there had been an increase in the number of international conventions and the relevant bodies , the Secretariat had not expanded to the same degree to deal with the resulting heavier workload .
That , in turn , caused many problems .
For example , the members of the Committee had no systematic access to information relating to torture and they had to reply on allegations that they had received directly or the occasional newspaper article that they might have noticed .
21 . Six years previously , the Chairpersons had recommended the creation of a documentation room for documents on States whose reports were under consideration and other relevant information , as well as the computerization of the relevant human rights bodies .
The Secretary-General had endorsed the proposal , but it had not been possible to implement it for lack of funding , and he had therefore called upon all Member States of the United Nations to make voluntary contributions to help finance the investments needed .
Of the nearly 180 States to which the request for contributions had been made , however , only three had responded favourably , and the funds offered were inadequate ; the Secretary-General was still seeking other sponsors .
22 . A number of Committees had made general observations and recommendations on a range of subjects , such as working methods and interpretations of conventions , which they had addressed to all States .
Document HRI / GEN / 1 contained a summary of those observations and recommendations and was useful reading for the members of the Committee against Torture , who should likewise undertake from time to time to adopt general observations , recommendations and even interpretations of the Convention against Torture and the rules of procedure .
23 . Another suggestion by the Chairpersons was that the Secretariat should systematically inform non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) when the report of a given State was about to be considered so that information could be received on that State .
A regular gleaning of several reliable newspapers would provide up-to-date sources of information on torture .
24 . Concerning interaction between Committees , the Committee against Torture had followed the recommendations of the Chairpersons and had appointed a rapporteur for each Committee in the field of human rights .
In certain Committees , that method had not always worked well , but the Committee against Torture would continue with it for the time being .
It would be useful to receive short summaries of the reports of the various Committees .
The possibility of joint meetings had also been considered when areas of concern overlapped : for example , the Human Rights Committee also dealt with torture to a certain extent .
In his view , however , such joint meetings were too unwieldy , but a meeting of the Chairpersons or delegates from Committees might prove useful .
25 . The Chairpersons had found that efforts to inform the public about the work of the Committees had been inadequate and that it was therefore necessary to step up the information campaign , giving priority to the drafting , translation and distribution of publications on human rights .
They also envisaged the establishment of a group of experts to review information policy and to elaborate a new strategy that would take account of the needs of the public in all countries .
They had expressed their satisfaction that each State party had undertaken to distribute in its territory its report and the summary records of the meetings at which the report had been considered by a particular committee .
26 . The Chairpersons had reported on the informal meeting of the Committee on the Rights of the Child , held in Quito and financed by UNICEF and they were of the view that that successful initiative could be attempted elsewhere .
He agreed with them , but he did not see who would finance such an effort by the Committee against Torture .
27 . With regard to the World Conference on Human Rights , the Chairpersons had said that the representatives of the various Committees should be able to collaborate more closely and have the full right to take the floor at the meetings of the Preparatory Committee .
They should also be represented at regional meetings , but , once again , for the Committee against Torture , that was primarily a financial question .
The Chairpersons had also supported the establishment of an ad hoc working group to consider the application of instruments in force , to evaluate their working methods and mechanisms and to make recommendations as necessary to the General Assembly with a view to improving effectiveness , and they had also discussed creating a special advisory body for the World Conference to serve as a link between member States and NGOs .
28 . Another issue raised by the Chairpersons , although less important for the Committee against Torture , was that many conventions , such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child , allowed reservations to be made that were so general that they seriously undermined the obligations that States had assumed in signing such instruments .
The Committee against Torture , for its part , was more interested in convincing a larger number of States parties to the Convention against Torture to accept the procedure under its articles 20 , 21 and 22 .
29 . The Chairpersons had expressed their concern about massive human rights violations in a number of countries and had endorsed the proposal that the Committees should be able to make recommendations to the Security Council when such violations had occurred .
He agreed that that was an interesting proposal because , when violations took place in a given country , the Committee against Torture would not simply have to wait until the next report appeared four years later or for the procedure under article 20 to take its course , but could immediately report the violations to the Security Council for action .
In that context , the Human Rights Committee had already taken innovative action : concerned by the situation in the former Yugoslavia , it had decided not to wait until the next report was due on the situation there , but had convinced the various groups in the former Yugoslavia to report immediately on the human rights situation in their regions .
The Committee against Torture might also consider the possibility of taking such urgent action .
30 . The Chairpersons had given thought to the drafting of new optional protocols to existing conventions , for example , to the Convention against Torture , but had agreed that the number of treaty monitoring bodies should not be increased because that would hamper their effectiveness and increase the tendency of their work to overlap .
31 . Lastly , the international conventions had been translated into many languages and it would be helpful to have a collection of those translations for use in seminars and conferences .
32 . Mr. SORENSEN , referring to the problem of how to deal with countries that had not submitted reports , said that the Committee should serve notice that it would consider the situation of human rights in such countries with or without reports .
He was under the impression that other Committees were already adopting such an approach and , in his view , the Committee against Torture should follow suit .
33 . The CHAIRMAN said that he agreed with Mr. Sorensen .
Despite repeated written requests , two countries , Togo and Uganda , had still not submitted their reports , which had been due for more than four years .
The Committee might decide to consider the human rights situations in those countries at its next session , with or without their reports , after inviting representatives of those countries to attend .
34 . Mrs. KLEIN-BIDMON ( Representative of the Secretary-General ) noted that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination had already used that method for the periodic reports of countries that had submitted at least one report , but not for a country that had never submitted a report .
35 . The CHAIRMAN said that there seemed to be all the more reason to proceed in that way if a country had never submitted a report , even though it had signed the Convention .
36 . Mr. GIL LAVEDRA said that the problem required more thorough discussion .
He did not see which provision of the Convention against Torture allowed the Committee to consider the situation of a country without a report .
Clearly , article 19 required countries to submit a report and non-submission was in violation of the Convention , but no rule allowed the Committee to consider the situation : in so doing , it would be going beyond its terms of reference .
The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.

CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS SUBMITTED BY STATES PARTIES UNDER ARTICLE 19 OF THE CONVENTION ( agenda item 4 ) ( continued )
Initial report of Germany ( CAT / C / 12 / Add.1 )
1 . At the invitation of the Chairman , Mr. Mayer-Ladewig , Mr. Daum , Mr. Siegismund , Mrs. Chwolik-Lanfermann and Mr. Schemel ( Germany ) took places at the Committee table .
2 . Mr. MAYER-LADEWIG ( Germany ) , introducing his country &apos;s initial report ( CAT / C / 12 / Add.1 ) , said that the Federal Republic of Germany was aware of its special responsibilities with regard to the Convention .
The prohibition against torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment was a feature of the German Constitution and other legislation .
A well-developed system of legal protection also helped to ensure that the practical implementation of legislation was subject to permanent and stringent control .
In its Constitution , the Basic Law , the Federal Republic of Germany declared its commitment to uphold human rights , guaranteed the inviolability of human dignity and also obliged &quot; all State authority &quot; to respect and protect it .
In accordance with the rulings of the Federal Constitutional Court , the principle that human dignity should be respected also meant that cruel , inhuman and degrading punishments were prohibited .
Moreover , for persons in official custody , protection was clarified and expressed in concrete terms in the second sentence of article 104 ( 1 ) of the Basic Law , which prescribed that detained persons could not be subjected to mental or to physical ill-treatment .
3 . The effective implementation of the Convention required a system of controls , which was guaranteed in Germany under constitutional law .
Article 19 ( 4 ) of the Basic Law contained a guarantee of recourse to the courts which was available to anyone whose rights had been violated by a public authority .
The German Penal Code did not contain a general offence of &quot; torture &quot; .
However , there were specific offences which would be penalized in the manner provided for by the Convention .
For example , the offences of assault and battery in office ( sect . 340 of the Penal Code ) and the extraction of testimony by duress ( sect . 343 of the Penal Code ) were punishable under criminal law .
Section 136 ( a ) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was particularly important because it prohibited , inter alia , any impairment , by the use of ill-treatment , of freedom of decision and the voluntary manifestation of will and could be invoked to prohibit the use of a testimony obtained under duress .
4 . The legal provisions on remand custody helped to promote and thereby achieve the aims of the Convention .
Under those provisions , arrest warrants had to meet certain requirements , confinement could be reviewed at any time and it was more difficult for remand custody to be extended beyond six months .
5 . When individuals were held in custody on the order of the State , it was particularly important that the provisions of the Convention should be implemented .
Such custody could involve prison , psychiatric institutions or police custody for individuals under provisional arrest .
Domestic legislation ensured that a regular and systematic review of the confinement and commitment of detainees was carried out by members of the administration , committees or specially appointed parliamentary bodies .
6 . He pointed out that legal remedies in Germany were not restricted to the domestic level .
Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was directly applicable in Germany and citizens could file applications with the European Commission of Human Rights .
Germany had also recognized the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights in accordance with article 46 of the European Convention .
7 . The German Federal Government was able to state that , in practice , there had been very few incidents where the conduct of public officials had violated the Convention , as shown by national statistics and by those of the European Court of Human Rights .
Offences of assault and battery in office for the most part involved teachers who had been convicted for applying corporal punishment .
Other convictions related to isolated incidents in cases where blood samples had been taken from drivers of motor vehicles .
According to the statistics of the European Court of Human Rights , there had been no instance where Germany had been deemed to have violated the prohibition against torture contained in article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
One case was , however , pending .
8 . The most effective way to ensure that torture was not practised was to provide State employees and public officials with adequate training and to familiarize them with the provisions of the Convention against Torture .
Germany &apos;s rules on training guaranteed that provision was made for the relevant instruction .
Trainee police officers were , for example , taught how to deal with conflict situations and how best to avoid them .
An important role in training individuals to treat people fairly was also played by advanced training courses , to which particular importance was attached in the new Länder , where , prior to reunification , conditions of detention might not always have been in conformity with the law .
9 . With regard to the unfortunate events which had recently taken place in Germany , namely , the violence directed against foreigners , the German Federal Government was taking great pains , in cooperation with the Länder and democratic forces , to put an end to such acts .
The police had sometimes been criticized for not intervening early enough to protect the victims of such violence .
However , it did not suggest that the incidents had been instigated by the police or carried out with the latter &apos;s express or tacit agreement .
10 . As to article 3 of the Convention , section 51 ( 1 ) of the Aliens Act in Germany prohibited deportation in cases of political persecution , namely , where the life or liberty of an alien had been threatened as a result of his race , religion , nationality , his membership of a specific social group or his political convictions .
Section 53 ( 1 ) also provided that no alien could be deported to a country in which he faced a threat of torture .
11 . In Germany , prisoners in remand custody or sentenced in connection with terrorist offences were treated in exactly the same way as other prisoners .
Where security measures requiring certain restrictions had to be taken in individual cases , the yardstick used in ordering such measures was very strict .
Thereafter , careful reviews were carried out to determine whether the measures had to be maintained .
12 . The CHAIRMAN , speaking as Country Rapporteur , said that he found the report of Germany detailed and specific .
However , it referred both to &quot; Germany &quot; and to &quot; the Federal Republic of Germany &quot; , which he assumed were one and the same .
He noted from the report that German legislation did not contain any specific provisions on torture .
He therefore wondered if there might not be some gaps , since physical torture was covered by provisions of the Penal Code , whereas mental torture was covered only when threats were involved .
He emphasized that torture also included acts such as giving a detainee false information in order to induce him to make a confession by wearing down his resistance .
He asked whether such acts were punishable in Germany .
13 . Referring to paragraph 60 of the report , which stated that &quot; preliminary detention can be ordered in accordance with section 112 of the Code of Criminal Procedure if there is a danger that the accused will flee &quot; , he noted that article 6 of the Convention related to arrest , regardless of where the crime had been committed .
The report did not deal with that aspect or state whether German legislation made a distinction between the geographical scope of article 5 and that of article 6 of the Convention .
14 . He requested clarification on whether German legislation fully implemented all of the provisions of article 7 of the Convention .
As to article 8 , paragraph 68 of the report stated that &quot; the Federal Republic of Germany is among those States which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty &quot; . Did that imply that article 8 was being fully implemented because of the rule that the international conventions to which Germany was a party were applied directly , even if they had not been expressly incorporated in domestic legislation ?
15 . In relation to article 9 of the Convention , paragraph 69 of the report stated that &quot; The Federal Republic meets the obligation arising from this provision of the Convention to afford other States parties the &apos; greatest measure of assistance &apos; in conformity with existing treaties on mutual judicial assistance &quot; .
He nevertheless thought that article 9 of the Convention went further and required that judicial assistance should be granted to all other States parties to the Convention , regardless of whether a treaty on mutual judicial assistance existed . Was that requirement also being met in accordance with the principle that the provisions of a convention to which Germany was a party were applied directly ?
The report seemed to imply that the systematic monitoring of police and of the instructions , methods and practices of interrogation , as referred to in article 11 of the Convention , was not necessary , since violations of article 11 were rare .
However , the implementation of article 11 was intended as a preventive measure .
No State could rule out the possibility that violations of human rights might occur .
He requested the German delegation to provide further information in that regard .
16 . The English text of paragraph 89 of the report relating to article 15 of the Convention stated that , &quot; If the accused asserts convincingly that his confession was extorted by the police or the prosecution through torture or other prohibited methods of interrogation , the judge must , ex officio , investigate the matter &quot; .
The French text , which used the words &quot; Si l &apos;accusé prouve &quot; , should therefore be brought into line with the English because it was not up to the accused to prove that he had been a victim of torture .
17 . Mr. MIKHAILOV ( Alternate Country Rapporteur ) commended the German report , which was both detailed and objective .
He praised Germany &apos;s democratic traditions and said that his own country had learned a great deal from its legislation and jurisprudence .
Since the German Constitution embodied the principle that human dignity had to be respected , he wished to know whether that was the basis on which it could be assumed that torture and other cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment were prohibited .
If such an assumption was deemed to be adequate , why was torture expressly referred to in article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and , of course , the Convention against Torture ?
18 . He also wished to know why the Penal Code did not contain specific provisions for combating torture .
He noted that , in paragraph 24 of the report , it was stated that &quot; Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights is deemed a directly enforceable provision in German domestic law and has the same force as federal law enacted by the German legislative &quot; and asked whether the provisions of the Convention against Torture were likewise directly applicable . Were there any obstacles to that application ?
19 . According to paragraph 32 of the report , a public official who caused bodily harm during the exercise of or in connection with his duties was to be punished by imprisonment from three months to five years , and for not less than two years if serious bodily harm had been caused . Was there a maximum sentence for such serious cases and were all forms of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment covered by that provision ?
20 . With regard to paragraph 53 of the report , where reference was made to &quot; the typical conception of &apos; torture &apos; &quot; , he asked whether the German delegation had in mind conception set forth in the Convention or the conception as understood in German domestic law ?
21 . Concerning paragraph 75 of the report , was German legislation directly applicable in the five new Länder or did special provisions apply ?
22 . He also asked whether the compensation referred to in paragraph 87 , only concerned torture or also included other forms of ill-treatment .
23 . Mr. BURNS joined his colleagues in commending the German delegation on its comprehensive report and detailed statement .
24 . He asked whether the current State assumed jurisdiction for acts of cruel or unusual punishment committed by officials of the former State , for example , with regard to prisoners and detainees .
25 . He sought clarification on the concept of &quot; remand custody &quot; , to which reference had been made by the German representative in his statement .
In his own country , Canada , that term generally meant that a court had intervened and ruled that a prisoner could be held for a certain period on remand before being brought forward for trial . Was there a limit to the length of time that a person could be held ? Was there a difference between the powers of arrest and custody for State security matters and for civil police matters ?
He also wished to know whether there were any circumstances that allowed the police to hold a person incommunicado and for how long .
26 . Mr. DIPANDA MOUELLE said that he would like to have some general information on the workings of the German judiciary . How many courts were there , how were magistrates appointed and what was the relationship of the courts to the other two branches of power ?
27 . Turning to paragraph 53 of the report , he asked what other persons in office , apart from teachers , had been convicted by German courts for assault and battery .
28 . Referring to paragraph 87 , he asked which court had jurisdiction to hear requests for compensation and whether such a case could be brought before criminal , civil and administrative courts at the same time .
Concerning a comment made in the statement by the German representative , he asked for further clarification about cases of abuse in connection with blood samples being taken from drivers of motor vehicles .
29 . Mr. SORENSEN said that he had been the head of the delegation of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture which had visited Germany in 1991 and which had enjoyed Germany &apos;s complete cooperation .
That delegation had just submitted its report , which was still confidential , and he would therefore not take part in the current discussion .
He did , however , wish to point out that , although he was pleased that medical personnel in Germany received education in ethics , the Convention required medical personnel to be educated about torture and the treatment of torture victims .
The same applied to the police .
In view of the enormous refugee problem Germany faced , the border police must be taught to recognize torture victims .
Usually , such victims were ashamed and reluctant to reveal that they had been abused .
30 . Mr. BEN AMMAR asked whether the German Constitution in force in the Federal Republic before reunification was currently applicable throughout the reunified Germany and whether any amendments had been made to it .
The statistics provided related to the Federal Republic before reunification and he asked whether there were any statistics on the former German Democratic Republic .
31 . Like Mr. Burns , he wished to know whether abuses under the old system of the German Democratic Republic were being prosecuted or whether an amnesty had been declared and he also inquired whether compensation was being paid to the victims of the former regime .
32 . According to section 136 ( a ) of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( para . 33 of the report ) , force could be applied only so far as was permitted by the law of criminal procedure .
He asked for examples of cases in which force could be used .
33 . Concerning paragraph 66 , he wondered whether the principle of discretionary prosecution was not in conflict with certain obligations under the Convention .
34 . Referring to police investigation and interrogation and prison conditions , he asked whether there was a code of ethics for the police and prison staff .
35 . In his view , a vast education campaign was needed in the former German Democratic Republic , not only for the police and prison authorities , but at all levels of the German school system .
That would help reduce the number of unfortunate incidents to which the German representative had alluded .
36 . Mr. EL IBRASHI thanked the German delegation for its comprehensive report and its clear statement .
37 . Like Mr. Burns and Mr. Ben Ammar , he wished to have more details about how the Convention was applied in the new Länder . Had changes been introduced into Land law ? What was the legal situation with regard to crimes committed under the former regime before the new laws had been introduced ?
38 . Referring to paragraphs 26 and 27 of the report , he said that he was not clear whether the Convention took precedence over the German Constitution .
If a court found that there was a contradiction between a provision of domestic law and the Convention , which would prevail ?
39 . According to paragraph 14 of the report , persons who could not pay the costs of legal proceedings received legal aid if the prosecution had sufficient prospects of success . Who decided whether such prospects existed and on what basis and what did the term &quot; prospects &quot; mean ?
40 . Concerning the reference to the use of force in paragraph 33 , which Mr. Ben Ammar had already mentioned , he asked when force could be used , what kind of force was allowed and whether it was limited to self-defence .
41 . With regard to education , he wondered whether any effort was being made in faculties of law to instil awareness of the question of torture .
42 . Like Mr. Burns , he wished to know whether there was a limit on the length of time a person could be kept in custody by the police and what the authority was to which a detainee could appeal . How long could a judge keep a person in custody ?
43 . He would welcome clarification on the first two sentences of paragraph 43 .
He did not understand what the problem was in refusing to extradite .
44 . In paragraph 89 , he did not see why it was necessary to say that the use of a statement which had been obtained in violation of the prohibition on extorting a confession through torture rendered the conviction subject to appeal ; after all , everything was subject to appeal , so that was not sufficient .
The public meeting rose at 11.20 a.m.

CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS SUBMITTED BY STATES PARTIES UNDER ARTICLE 19 OF THE CONVENTION ( agenda item 4 ) ( continued )
Additional report of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ( CAT / C / 9 / Add.12 )
1 . At the invitation of the Chairman , Mr. Hafyana , Mr. El Fakih Saleh , Ms. Markus , and Ms. Hajjagi ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) took places at the Committee table .
2 . Mr. HAFYANA ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) commended the Committee on its efforts to ensure the implementation of the Convention , which , since its ratification by the Jamahiriya , had taken precedence over the provisions of national law .
Recalling that he had introduced his country &apos;s initial report ( CAT / C / 9 / Add.7 ) in November 1991 , he apologized for the delay , due to circumstances beyond Libya &apos;s control , in submitting the additional report requested by the Committee .
3 . The additional report ( CAT / C / 9 / Add.12 ) contained further information concerning the political system , the legislative and executive mechanisms and the judicial authority in the Jamahiriya .
With regard to the legal framework for the implementation of the Convention , it explained the status of international instruments under Libya &apos;s national law and showed how their provisions were binding on the courts , justice and equity being the main objectives .
With reference to the Convention , it described the provisions of the Penal Code that related to violations of personal freedoms ; those of the Code of Criminal Procedure that related to the legality of arrests ; and those of the Civil Code that related to compensation for damage .
Judicial safeguards were the subject of a further section of the report , which described the role of the Supreme Court in relation to article 15 of the Convention and contained details on the functioning of Libya &apos;s criminal , administrative and civil courts .
Great significance was attached to the existence of legislation guaranteeing the rights that the Convention sought to protect ; to the possibility of remedies for the protection of those rights whenever they had been subjected to infringement or violation ; and to public awareness of the importance of those rights .
4 . The report dealt with other questions raised by the members of the Committee during their consideration of the initial report , particularly with regard to the role and powers of the Attorney General ; the jurisdiction of the Libyan courts in the light of articles 5 , 6 , 8 and 9 of the Convention ; the issue of extradition ; the situation relating to the detention of suspects of Libyan nationality ; the definition of political offences ; interrogation and the persons responsible therefor ; the concept of violence ; offences punishable by death under the Libyan Penal Code ; the situation in respect of the death penalty ; conditions of detention in Libya in the light of article 6 of the Convention ; and the authority responsible for monitoring detention .
5 . The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was convinced of the need to guarantee the full implementation of the Convention and was committed to the establishment of all the legal and judicial safeguards and guarantees required for the exercise and the protection of human rights .
He would willingly reply to any further questions on the matter .
page 6 . Mr. SORENSEN ( Country Rapporteur ) thanked the Libyan delegation for its additional report and oral introduction , which went a long way towards answering the Committee &apos;s outstanding questions .
7 . The report contained a clear description of the functioning of the political system , the legislative and executive mechanisms and the judicial authority in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and he welcomed the statement on the independence of the judiciary , but he wished to know whether judges could be dismissed and , if so , by which authority . Was there a statutory retirement age ?
8 . He had found no reference in either of the Libyan reports to a constitutional court . Did the Supreme Court exercise that function in determining , for example , the legality of legislation and the consistency of Libya &apos;s laws with the Great Green Document on Human Rights in the Age of the Masses .
9 . Noting that the Attorney General was &quot; vested by law with sole competence to initiate criminal proceedings &quot; , he asked whether injured parties could request him to do so . Who were the parties who could bring allegations of torture : victims ; their relatives ; their neighbours ? Could the Attorney General refuse to entertain complaints and , if so , was any alternative remedy available , before the administrative or criminal courts , for example ?
It was stated on page 9 of the report that article 30 of the Libyan Code of Criminal Procedure corresponded to article 13 of the Convention , where the right to complain was provided for , but statistics on the number of complaints actually made would be helpful .
10 . According to the Penal Code , the crime of torture or incitation to torture was punishable by a term of 3 to 10 years &apos; imprisonment . Was the higher figure an absolute maximum , even , for example , when act of torture had resulted in the death of the victim , which was the equivalent in some countries of first-degree murder ?
In that connection , page 21 of the report stated that murder was a capital crime in Libya .
According to page 15 of the report , however , one of the sentences handed down by the criminal courts had been six months &apos; penal servitude for &quot; torture and abuse of authority &quot; .
That seemed to be in contradiction with the range of possible sentences he had just referred to .
11 . In the section on page 8 of the report describing article 431 of the Penal Code , it was stated that a fine of up to 250 dinars could be imposed on any public official who &quot; uses violence &quot; .
He assumed that &quot; violence &quot; meant acts falling short of torture .
The amount of fine , equivalent to about US $ 750 , seemed rather small . Was an upper limit set for the prison sentence associated with the fine or was that left to the judge &apos;s discretion ?
12 . Compensation , the subject of article 14 of the Convention , was dealt with in the Libyan report under the headings of the Civil Code , the Great Green Document on Human Rights and the People &apos;s Court Act . Was it necessary to await a verdict before a claim for compensation could be filed ? If a person found guilty of an act of torture was unable to pay compensation in the required manner , did the State assume that responsibility ? Were there many claims for compensation ?
13 . Concerning the Promotion of Freedom Act and the parts of the report which dealt with interrogation and the duration of custody , he requested the following clarifications on the rights of detained persons , especially during the critical period immediately after they had been taken in charge by the police : how soon must the next of kin of a person detained be notified ; could persons be held incommunicado and , if so , for how long ; when exactly was access to legal counsel allowed ; could a detained person remain silent until his lawyer was present ; what rules governed medical attendance ; after how long must a detained person be brought before a judge ; and at what point were detained persons informed of their rights ?
14 . He noted with satisfaction that the extradition from Libya of political refugees was prohibited , although article 3 of the Convention made substantial grounds for believing there to be a danger of torture a reason for the non-extradition of any person : was that the case in Libya ?
15 . As to page 21 of the report referring to the death penalty , he welcomed the indication that consideration was being given to the restriction of death sentences to a limited number of capital crimes .
He was somewhat surprised that economic crimes should be punishable by death under the Libyan Penal Code and he asked how the death sentence was imposed .
16 . On the subject of prison conditions , he asked whether inspections by representatives of non-governmental organizations were permitted and whether the complaints procedure for prisoners provided for uncensored access in writing to the Committee against Torture in Geneva , for example .
17 . Lastly , he stressed the importance of education in all aspects of human rights and of special education in matters relating to torture in order to enable border police , doctors and members of the health profession to identify victims of torture and take appropriate action . Was such education provided in Libya ?
18 . Mr. BURNS ( Alternate Country Rapporteur ) noted that enormous efforts had obviously gone into the preparation of Libya &apos;s additional report .
19 . The examples given on page 15 of the report of successful prosecutions of public officials were noteworthy and underscored the exemplary seriousness with which the Libyan authorities assumed the obligations contained in the Convention .
He would not presume to comment on the adequacy or otherwise of the sentences handed down .
20 . It was his understanding that , during a criminal trial , a victim of torture might apply to the criminal court for compensation and that he might independently bring a civil action . Was it established under Libyan law that the Government was also vicariously liable for the conduct of its agents and therefore responsible for paying compensation in the event that an agent found guilty was unable to do so ?
21 . Concerning the situation with regard to foreign nationals , he asked whether , if the Libyan authorities learned of the presence in the country &apos;s territory of a person who was a national of a country with which Libya had no extradition treaty and who was accused of torture in a country with which no extradition treaty existed either , jurisdiction existed under domestic law so that the person concerned might be arrested and brought to trial .
22 . With regard to article 9 of the Convention , he asked what arrangements had been made by Libya in respect of mutual judicial assistance . Had treaties been signed with other States parties to the Convention or was article 9 itself the binding text ?
23 . He asked about the way in which the role of the police , the public prosecutor and examining magistrates was described in relation to periods of detention .
He had found pages 18 , 19 and 20 of the report somewhat confusing .
On page 18 , it said that &quot; The accused must be interrogated by the office of the competent public prosecutor within 24 hours from the time at which he is referred thereto by the criminal investigation officer &quot; .
He assumed that the latter was a policeman , but requested clarification .
Within 24 hours following reference to the public prosecutor , the accused had to be interrogated and another decision then had to be taken on whether to release him or remand him in custody pending investigation .
Different officials and different periods of time were mentioned and it was unclear which time-limits were involved .
The report appeared to be saying that , when a police officer believed that a person had committed an offence , the person could not be held by the police officer for investigation unless he was willing to answer the questions put to him .
That was very unusual .
24 . On page 20 , the report stated that &quot; The accused can be held in custody only at a publicly designated location within the criminal jurisdiction area in which the offence was committed and he cannot be interrogated by the court without his consent &quot; .
He asked whether &quot; the court &quot; meant the examining magistrate or some other body .
It was also stated on page 20 that &quot; The accused also has the right to refuse to answer any question that is likely to prejudice his legal status in the proceedings &quot; .
However , it had been stated earlier that a police officer could hold a person only if he wished voluntarily to make a statement .
A public prosecutor could hold him for 24 hours to interrogate him and then he would be referred to an examining magistrate .
Those statements called for clarification .
With regard to pages 18 and 19 , which stated that &quot; During that period , the office of the public prosecutor must either remand the accused in custody pending investigation or release him &quot; , he wondered whether such custody was different from that referred to on page 11 as &quot; preventive detention &quot; .
He also wished to know how preventive detention was defined , what the legal time-limits were and when it was applied .
25 . As to the statement on page 20 that &quot; The accused can be held in custody ... and he cannot be interrogated by the court without his consent &quot; , he said that it was rather strange to refer to a kind of enforced custody when a person was making a voluntary statement .
In connection with the death penalty , he asked for statistics on how many persons had been sentenced to death and how many sentences had been carried out .
26 . Mr. MIKHAILOV congratulated the Libyan delegation on the report , but requested it to provide further information on the constitutional system , in particular , with regard to the differences between the various branches of power .
On page 2 , the report referred to &quot; people &apos;s congresses &quot; and , on page 3 , to the &quot; General People &apos;s Congress &quot; .
He requested clarification on the difference between those bodies , on how the Congress was elected and on whether political parties existed .
27 . Page 8 of the report referring to article 431 of the Penal Code and article 4 of the Convention mentioned the penalties which existed for any public official who , in the discharge of his duty , used violence against any person in such a way as to detract from his dignity or cause him physical pain . Did the Penal Code also provided for penalties for public officials who inflicted mental or moral suffering ?
Under article 167 of the Civil Code , a person would be held responsible for his unlawful acts committed at a time when he was able to distinguish between right and wrong .
He would like to know what criteria were applied in law to distinguish between right and wrong .
In relation to article 3 of the Convention , article 21 of the Promotion of Freedom Act No. 20 / 1991 stated that &quot; the Jamahiriya is a place of refuge for persecuted persons and freedom fighters &quot; . What was the difference between the acts of a freedom fighter and a terrorist act ? What criteria were used to decide to which category an act belonged ?
28 . On page 18 of the report , it was stated that &quot; The accused must be interrogated by the office of the competent public prosecutor within 24 hours from the time at which he is referred thereto by the criminal investigation officer &quot; .
He requested information on how the accused was able to obtain the assistance of a defence counsel at that time .
29 . Mr. GIL LAVEDRA said he welcomed the fact that there was a marked improvement in the current report by comparison with the earlier one submitted by Libya ( CAT / C / 9 / Add.7 ) .
He also asked for clarifications on the scope of the term &quot; torture &quot; , as used in article 435 of the Penal Code , and on whether it covered both physical and psychological harm .
30 . In the light of the explanations in Part One of the report of how the Convention had been incorporated into Libyan law , he asked whether the Convention itself could serve as the legal basis for the implementation of article 3 , rather than article 9 , paragraph 5 , of the Penal Code , as referred to on page 11 of the report .
He also wished to know whether detainees were entitled to medical examinations .
Like Mr. Burns , he wondered how many death sentences had been carried out and what other types of punishment could be imposed for serious crimes .
31 . Mr. DIPANDA MOUELLE congratulated the Libyan delegation on the additional report .
While he agreed with other members of the Committee that the report answered many of the questions raised in connection with the initial report , there were still points that required clarification .
32 . In the first place , replies to questions should have been given in relation to and following the order of the articles of the Convention , both for the sake of clarity and in accordance with the general guidelines regarding the form and contents of reports to be submitted by States parties .
He requested further information on the definition of torture , since the report did not give one , and asked whether moral and mental torture was punishable under Libyan law .
In connection with the statement on page 5 of the report that &quot; The Attorney General is vested by law with sole competence to institute criminal proceedings , except in cases in which a criminal action can be brought only by the injured party or by the Minister of Justice &quot; , he asked which cases were being referred to and whether , in cases in which only the Minister of Justice could institute criminal proceedings , he could decide not to do so where a citizen had informed him in writing of a violation of his human rights .
33 . With regard to page 15 , which listed several cases in which public officials had been tried and punished for crimes of torture , he inquired about the specific nature of penal servitude and forced labour . Were such penalties provided for in the Penal Code and were they imposed at the discretion of the judge ? Was forced labour in accordance with the Convention ?
On page 21 , it was stated that economic crimes were punishable by death under the Libyan Penal Code .
He was not sure exactly what an economic crime was and whether it included offences such as forgery . Was it not true that such a penalty was out of proportion to the nature of the crime ?
If executions were public , they could be characterized as degrading treatment and were thus prohibited under the Convention .
He requested clarifications on the organization of the judiciary and the courts and on whether the constitutional court operated as a Supreme Court . How were judges appointed and was there a disciplinary body to ensure that they carried out their duties properly ?
34 . He requested the Libyan delegation to provide information on the extent to which daily life in Libya and the economy of the country had been disrupted by the air embargo .
35 . Mr. BEN AMMAR , commending the Libyan delegation on the additional report , said it had shown that legal and judicial authority was derived from the people and that the people &apos;s sovereignty was guaranteed through the General People &apos;s Congress and the people &apos;s congresses .
Account must , however , be taken of the principle of the separation of powers .
Each power had to exercise its functions as freely and as well as possible in order to ensure that citizens enjoyed their fundamental rights and that human dignity was respected .
The report stressed that the judiciary was independent , but it did not explain who appointed judges or on whose decision they were promoted or punished .
36 . He wished to know whether there was any organic link between the police officer or department who arrested an individual and the authority which instituted the criminal proceedings on the one hand , and the investigating authorities and the courts which handed down sentences , on the other .
Clarification was needed with regard to the People &apos;s Court and its relationship with civil , criminal and other courts .
Since it was stated on page 10 of the report that &quot; the People &apos;s Court is competent to hear appeals against measures or decisions that are prejudicial to the freedom and other basic rights of citizens &quot; , he wondered whether it replaced the Appeals Court .
37 . He also asked whether the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention against Torture were included in training programmes for police officers , prison officials , doctors and their assistants .
Given Libya &apos;s commitment to defending fundamental freedoms , did it support the draft optional protocol to the Convention on visits to prisons and detention centres which would be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly and was it prepared to accept articles 21 and 22 of that draft optional protocol ?
Since torture was practised in various countries , did the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya also support the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture and intend to set up special medical centres to treat victims of torture , as had been done in many other countries ?
38 . Mr. EL IBRASHI commended Libya &apos;s efforts to give effect to the principles embodied in the Convention .
With regard to the principle of the legality of legislation ( rules of justice and equity ) referred to on page 7 of the report , which stated that any citizen had the right to challenge the legality of any legislation that was not based on the rules of justice and equity before the courts , did that mean that the courts could repeal or amend legislation if it was incompatible with the rules of justice and equity and did it affect the principle of the constitutionality of the law in Libya ?
39 . Since Libya had undertaken to implement the Convention following ratification , he wondered whether the Convention had become part of Libyan legislation .
He also asked whether the courts applied the Convention directly and whether an individual could , when claiming that one of this rights should be respected , base his actions on the principles embodied in the Convention . How were crimes in Libya classified as serious and lesser offences and what criteria were used ?
40 . He asked whether the Attorney General was responsible for investigations or whether it was the examining magistrate or another body . Did the Attorney General and the courts have the authority to consider questions concerning detention by the police ? Did Libyan law provide that no case could be heard in the absence of a defence lawyer ?
41 . Concerning article 14 of the Convention , the report made it clear that responsibility for compensation lay with the person committing the crime .
The victim had the right to be a party to prosecution and could take active part in the proceedings .
In the case of administrative inquiries , however , if the court found the accused innocent , could the administrative court drop the investigation ? Did the criminal and administrative courts have different areas of jurisdiction ?
42 . With reference to page 19 of the report , he asked whether individual amnesty annulled all responsibility . Did it extinguish both the crime and the punishment , as suggested on page 20 of the report ? Could an individual sentenced to 10 years in prison be released after 6 months or was there a minimum sentence that he must serve before qualifying for an amnesty ?
43 . The CHAIRMAN , speaking as a member of the Committee , thanked the Libyan delegation for its report , which was much more exhaustive and informative than the previous one and had simplified the Committee &apos;s task .
44 . On page 4 of the report , reference had been made , in the paragraphs on the judicial authority , to personal status courts which applied Islamic law . Were such courts competent only in civil matters or did they also have other areas of jurisdiction and , if so , what were they ?
45 . Page 8 of the report stated that the use of violence against persons , if accompanied by detention , constituted mental torture .
Yet detention was not the only possible case of mental torture and not even the most common one .
Moreover , detention was usually legitimate and he asked the Libyan delegation for clarification on how mental torture was punished under Libyan law .
46 . With regard to extradition , page 11 of the report referred to article 21 of the Promotion of Freedom Act , but ruled out refoulement or expulsion and he therefore wondered whether the Libyan delegation considered that article 3 of the Convention was being directly applied .
47 . The report contained no reference to article 11 of the Convention and he asked for some clarification on that provision .
48 . The report of Mr. Kooijmans , the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on torture ( E / CN.4 / 1992 / 17 ) , referred to a letter sent by the Special Rapporteur to the Government of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya transmitting information concerning a particular case .
He noted that there had been no reply to that letter and he therefore asked the Libyan representatives if they were familiar with the case and whether they could inform the Committee how it had been followed up .
49 . Mr. HAFYANA ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that the Jamahiriya had always been committed to complying with its obligations under international instruments , including the Convention against Torture , and it had incorporated the Convention in its domestic legislation .
He expressed his appreciation for the objectivity shown by the Committee in carrying out its important task .
50 . Mr. Hafyana , Mr. El Fakih Saleh , Ms. Markus and Ms. Hajjagi ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) withdrew .
51 . The meeting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon .
Supplementary report of Mexico ( CAT / C / 17 / Add.3 )
52 . At the invitation of the Chairman , Mr. Heller , Ms. Carvalho de Plasa and Mr. Ruiz y Avila ( Mexico ) took places at the Committee table .
53 . Mr. HELLER ( Mexico ) said that Mexico shared the concern of the international community to protect fundamental human rights and , to that end , had signed and ratified a number of international and regional instruments .
By acceding to the Convention against Torture , which was in harmony with the Mexican Constitution , it had reaffirmed the applicability in its territory of the rights recognized in the Convention .
54 . The supplementary report ( CAT / C / 17 / Add.3 ) covered the period 1988-1992 and discussed the measures adopted by the Mexican Government to prevent and punish torture .
55 . Mexico attached great importance to the Convention because it covered a particularly sensitive area .
His Government was convinced that universal awareness of human rights could be strengthened only through international cooperation that took account of national efforts , the responsibility of States in complying with their commitments and respect for internal jurisdiction .
It was in that spirit that his delegation submitted the supplementary report , which had been drafted in June 1992 .
56 . Since the submission of the initial report in July 1988 , there had been a number of important legislative , administrative and judicial developments .
57 . When President Salinas de Gortari had inaugurated the work of the National Human Rights Commission ( CNDH ) on 6 June 1990 , he had reaffirmed Mexico &apos;s commitment to defending , promoting and protecting the human rights of Mexicans in the country and abroad and of foreigners in the national territory , as well as to punishing those who violated such rights .
Putting an end to impunity had constituted one of the CNDH &apos;s principal mandates .
58 . The CNDH did not replace the bodies entrusted with the administration of justice .
Instead , in many ways , it resembled the ombudsmen found in other countries .
It did not interfere with the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary .
It had programmes for the follow-up of complaints of human rights violations and it proposed programmes in the legal , educational and cultural spheres , as well as action to improve compliance with the international instruments that Mexico had signed .
59 . The CNDH operated at three levels .
First , it investigated complaints case by case .
It made public recommendations to the competent authorities and could request information from them in the course of its investigations .
All its documents were made public on a periodic basis .
Its transparent actions and recommendations had earned it the recognition of Mexican society and had helped to bring about a fundamental change in the relationship between the population , non-governmental organizations and official institutions .
60 . The second level at which the CNDH was active was in proposing amendments to Mexican legislation and recommending accession to various international instruments in order to ensure full observance of the rule of law .
61 . The CNDH &apos;s third type of activity involved the building in Mexico of a human rights culture that gave substance to the high aspiration of the Government and society to achieve the true promotion of human rights , beginning with the area of prevention , through the education and training of persons administering justice .
62 . On 24 June 1992 , with the unanimous approval of all the political parties , the CNDH had acquired constitutional status which guaranteed that the reforms achieved and progress made would be irreversible .
63 . The new political , economic and social reality had led to a systematic revision of Mexico &apos;s legislation .
The reform of the 1986 Federal Act to Prevent and Punish Torture and various amendments to the Penal Code and the Code of Penal Procedure , adopted by the Congress of the Union , had been significant steps in the development of the Mexican judicial system .
64 . In that process , the Federal Executive had endorsed a number of proposals by the CNDH for the adoption of legislative and administrative measures .
That was the case with the various reforms of the Federal and State Penal Codes , as well as of the Federal and Federal District Codes of Penal Procedure , which Congress had approved .
65 . On a proposal by the CNDH , draft legislation had been introduced to amend the Federal Act on the Responsibilities of Public Servants with a view to making it obligatory for the latter to provide information that the CNDH requested in the course of an investigation .
66 . At the last ordinary session of Congress , the Federal Executive had submitted draft legislation to amend article 102 of the Constitution so as to authorize the Congress and the state legislatures to establish human rights protection bodies .
A new draft Federal Act to Prevent and Punish Torture had also been introduced .
67 . The Attorney General &apos;s Office had been reorganized and the officials of the Federal Public Prosecutor &apos;s Department and its subsidiary bodies , such as the Federal Judicial Police , had become more professional .
Officials in the Federal Public Prosecutor &apos;s Department must take a training course and sit a competitive examination .
Federal Judicial Police officers must complete a preparatory course of 180 days after being chosen on the basis of their expertise and attitudes .
Special measures had also been introduced to assist persons who were suspected of having committed illegal acts or who were under investigation by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Department , as well as their families and the victims of the offence .
68 . It had been necessary to amend the Federal Act to Prevent and Punish Torture .
In its new form , the Federal Act improved on instruments for the protection of citizens and provided for harsher penalties for anyone who violated the physical or moral integrity of any human being .
Article 3 of the Federal Act was based closely on the wording of the Convention against Torture .
69 . The new Federal Act expanded the procedural rights of persons under investigation for an offence , ensured the rights of Indians to be defended in their own language and made provision for the benefits of a pardon or amnesty to be extended to the most needy .
70 . The new legislation provided that confessions made to police authorities could not be admitted as evidence .
The same applied to statements to the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Department or a judicial authority without the presence of the accused person &apos;s defence counsel , or confidant and , where appropriate , interpreter .
71 . Acts of torture would be punished by 3 to 12 years in prison ( 2 to 10 years previously ) .
A person found guilty had the obligation to meet the legal advice , medical and any other costs incurred to provide redress for the injury and to compensate the victim or his dependants in the case of loss of life , loss of freedom , loss of property , loss of earnings , impairment of health , unfitness to work and impairment of reputation .
72 . The Federal Executive had the obligation to conduct continuing programmes for the prevention of torture .
73 . One of the CNDH &apos;s first activities to promote public awareness had been to organize a national workshop against torture with the participation of distinguished Mexican and international experts .
The workshop had concluded that torture was a complex and multifaceted phenomenon with legal , socio-economic , educational , psychological and moral causes and that it must be attacked at its roots , as the competent authorities had indeed been doing .
74 . Subsequently , the President of the Republic had been given a package of reforms of the Federal , State and Federal District Codes of Penal Procedure aimed at ensuring that confessions made to the police authorities could no longer be admitted as evidence .
The reforms guaranteed the firm but dignified treatment of persons who had broken the law .
75 . The Attorney General &apos;s Office had introduced various programmes to ensure that detainees were treated well and their human rights respected .
It had established special procedures and mechanisms , through its Internal Control Unit , to detect , investigate and punish torture in order to prevent impunity .
In September 1991 , it had created the Comprehensive Information and Care Programme for Detainees and Addicts , a mechanism to ensure full respect for individual guarantees .
On 12 March 1992 , the Attorney General had created the Multipartite Citizens &apos; Committee to monitor the activities of the Attorney General &apos;s Office and ensure that they were carried out within the limits of the law .
The Committee was composed of members of the main political parties .
76 . For three years , the National Institute of Criminal Sciences and the Federal Judicial Police Institute had been conducting a series of programmes to improve the scientific and technical expertise needed for the investigation of offences .
Emphasis had been placed on training Federal Judicial Police Officers in problems relating to the protection of human rights .
77 . The relentless fight against impunity had been yielding positive results .
Regarding the impact of the various measures adopted to combat torture , the number of complaints brought before the CNDH had fallen since 1990 , when it had taken up its work .
For the period June-December 1990 , allegations of torture had headed the list of all complaints of alleged human rights violations ( 13.4 per cent ) .
They had still been the leading complaint for the period December 1990-May 1991 , with 13.9 per cent , but had dropped to third place ( 6.2 per cent ) in June-December 1991 and to seventh place ( only 2.9 per cent ) in the latest period , from December 1991 to June 1992 .
The Government of Mexico was aware that the problem was not merely one of numbers and it objective was to ensure that there was no longer any reason to make such allegations .
78 . In its latest half-yearly report of May 1991 , the CNDH had reported that 266 public officials ( 110 federal , 151 local and 5 municipal ) had been penalized .
Criminal proceedings had been brought against 95 of those officials , a preliminary investigation had been initiated against 108 and 20 had been relieved of their functions , 24 had been suspended and 17 had received warnings .
79 . From November 1991 to May 1992 , the CNDH had made 110 recommendations to various authorities , 11 of which had concerned complaints of torture .
From June 1990 until CNDH &apos;s fourth half-yearly report of 25 May 1992 , 34 recommendations concerning torture had been made to the Attorney General &apos;s Office .
In 13 cases , criminal proceedings had been instituted and 2 preliminary investigations had been started in 1990 , 4 in 1991 and 7 in 1992 .
In only 2 of those 13 cases did the facts come within the period from May 1991 to date , coinciding with the administration of the current Attorney General of the Republic , Ignacio Morales Lechuga .
Those 13 cases involved 37 public officials who had been imprisoned pending trial .
80 . The various measures adopted and documented in the report reflected the firm commitment of the Government of Mexico to protect and promote human rights .
Mexico would spare no effort to combat impunity and eradicate torture .
81 . Mr. GIL LAVEDRA ( Country Rapporteur ) welcomed Mexico &apos;s very complete and informative report , which showed that a remarkable number of measures had been adopted by Mexico to combat torture .
An impressive information campaign had also been carried out to promote human rights .
He welcomed Mexico &apos;s determination to comply with the provisions of the Convention .
82 . In considering Mexico &apos;s initial report in 1989 , the Committee had praised its excellent quality and had noted Mexico &apos;s exemplary protection machinery .
The Committee had nevertheless requested further information on : compensation for damages ; education programmes and programmes to promote the Convention ; universal jurisdiction ; and the concrete application of the Convention .
83 . The supplementary report gave satisfactory replies to the first two of those questions , but he still had some doubts about the question of universal jurisdiction .
Since Mexico was a federal State and its individual states had powers to enact their own rules and regulations , and since article 133 of the Constitution applied only federally , he would like to be assured that the provisions of the Convention were applied throughout the territory .
Although the legislation for the prevention of torture was impressive , the Committee had received many reports from non-governmental organizations about acts of torture , particularly by the judicial police , for which there appeared to be a high degree of impunity .
The Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on torture had also referred to a number of such cases in the report ( E / CN.4 / 1992 / 17 ) and had written to the Government on the subject .
In paragraph 17 of its supplementary report ( CAT / C / 17 / Add.3 ) , the Mexican Government itself had acknowledged that certain violations persisted and had reaffirmed its commitment to continued progress in protecting human rights and punishing those responsible for violating them .
84 . It was encouraging to note that the National Human Rights Commission ( CNDH ) had been given constitutional status under article 112 of the Constitution .
The report submitted by the CNDH had confirmed that , contrary to the legislation and to article 4 , paragraph 2 , of the Convention , there had been a number of cases in which the persons responsible for violations had not been punished .
He noted that , of 274 recommendations made by the CNDH in respect of punishment , no action at all had been taken on 142 of them and most of the remainder had been only partially applied .
The cases listed in paragraph 100 of Mexico &apos;s report were mostly among the cases in which the CNDH had stated that its recommendations had not been applied and that no more than prior investigations had been made .
He would welcome further information concerning the number of persons imprisoned for the offences described and the sentences imposed on them .
85 . Of the 110 recommendations made by the CNDH during the six months up to June 1992 , 42 related to the state of prisons and some specifically to the treatment of detainees and inhuman conditions of detention .
There had been an alarming number of cases of murdered or missing journalists and other missing persons .
The CNDH had made a classification of complaints in which complaints of torture occupied seventh place , but it was possible that some of the other complaints , such as that of arbitrary detention , might also have been torture-related .
86 . The various corrective measures provided for in the amended Code of Penal Procedure and particularly the provision disallowing statements made to the police as evidence were excellent , but he wished to know whether the new measures applied only federally or whether the various states had also incorporated them into their own legislation .
On the question of the right to request a medical examination as provided for in article 7 of the Convention , he had always understood that all detainees must be medically examined .
87 . In view of the many legal provisions against the acts concerned , he was puzzled to know why there had been so many reports of unlawful detention and interrogation , ill-treatment and the use of coercion to extract confessions . Was volume 9 , part 3 , of the Police Training Manual , which stated that the objectives were to ascertain the truth , obtain confessions and collect evidence , still in operation ?
If so , that was seriously contrary to the provisions now in force .
88 . He attached considerable importance to the programmes of the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic and would be interested to know what reports had been received in that connection .
The programmes would , of course , take time to implement , but priority should be given to the need to deal with the question of impunity .
During the discussion of Mexico &apos;s previous report , Mr. Burns had asked whether Mexico intended to make a declaration under article 21 of the Convention and the Mexican delegation had replied that the matter was under consideration , but the Government had to consider the question of its compatibility with the existing legislation .
The new forms of control and monitoring available could help the Government in its determination to put a decisive end to the phenomenon of torture .
89 . Mr. LORENZO ( Alternate Country Rapporteur ) joined in expressing appreciation for the comprehensive report and the oral introduction .
He felt a great affinity with Mexico , which had saved the lives of many of his fellow countrymen in the past by offering them asylum from persecution .
90 . With regard to the work of the National Human Rights Commission ( CNDH ) , he would like to have more information about the conciliation process that had led to settlements out of court , as referred to in paragraph 61 of the report .
Although he was very much in favour of conciliation and arbitration , he feared that the process might lead to impunity for those responsible for offences - contrary to the provisions of the Convention , which required each State party to make acts of torture punishable .
91 . He had some doubts about the figures given in paragraph 61 of the report .
On the basis of those figures , there were still some 1,900 complaints on which no clear conclusion had been reached .
He would be interested to know how many of them were directly or indirectly linked to torture .
He had noted the statement that , without evidence , the CNDH could not support an accusation of torture . Were the victims themselves required to provide such evidence or was the CNDH required to investigate the case and secure the evidence ?
In the case described in paragraph 64 ( b ) , it was stated that the alleged victim , when visited in his place of imprisonment , had affirmed that he had never been tortured , deprived of food or ill-treated . Would such a statement be sufficient to cause the CNDH to cease to investigate the complaint , bearing in mind that the person concerned might have been subjected to pressure to withdraw his allegation ?
92 . He was also concerned about the statement in paragraph 65 of the report that the CNDH could not intervene without a clear indication of the acts which violated human rights , how and when they had occurred , which authorities had allegedly been responsible in each case and the names and addresses of the victims .
Victims were frequently unable to recognize the officials who had detained them .
There had been many complaints by non-governmental organizations that detainees had been blindfolded .
It was thus unreasonable to expect them to identify the persons responsible .
93 . He would like to have details of the penalties imposed on the 266 public officials referred to at the end of paragraph 99 .
He noted that criminal proceedings had been brought in only 95 of those cases , and he asked whether , in the remaining cases , only administrative penalties had been imposed .
He understood that in the Mexican legal system , administrative responsibility was distinct from criminal responsibility and there should therefore be no reason why criminal proceedings should not be instituted , in addition to administrative penalties .
The general impression from a reading of the report was that those responsible for torture were enjoying impunity .
A number of cases in which criminal proceedings had been brought were described in paragraph 100 , but nothing was said about any penalties imposed .
94 . Article 15 of the Convention required each State party to ensure that any statement established to have been made as a result of torture could not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings , yet there were repeated instances in Mexican courts in which statements made to the police were admitted as evidence and were given greater credence than subsequent statements in which they were denied .
Amnesty International and other non-governmental organizations had reported many such cases , in which evidence of torture had been produced , but there had been no review of the original confessions made by the victims under police interrogation .
The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.

The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.
PREPARATORY ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE WORLD CONFERENCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS ( agenda item 7 ) ( continued )
The text read :
&quot; The Committee against Torture ,
Pursuant to paragraph 9 of General Assembly resolution 45 / 155 of 18 December 1990 and paragraph 5 of Commission on Human Rights resolution 1991 / 30 of 5 March 1991,
1 . Decides to appoint Mr. Sorensen as representative and Mr. Mikhailov as alternate to the meetings of the Preparatory Committee of the World Conference on Human Rights ;
2 . Recommends that :
( i ) Member States of the United Nations that have not yet done so to become parties to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , including its articles 20 , 21 and 22 ; and
( ii ) Those States parties to the Convention that have not done so to declare in favour of the provisions of articles 20 , 21 and 22 ;
( b ) Improving the implementation of existing human rights standards and instruments should be a major focus of the preparatory process and at the Conference itself and that consideration should be given in that context to the following :
Based on the experience of the work done in the Committee against Torture :
( i ) Examination of the issues relevant to the implementation of the Convention ;
( ii ) Evaluation of the effectiveness of United Nations methods and mechanisms ; and
( iii ) Formulation of concrete recommendations for improving the effectiveness of United Nations mechanisms ( especially the functioning of the Convention against Torture ) aimed at promoting , encouraging and monitoring respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ;
( c ) In view of the unfortunate rise of ethnic violence , torture and other human rights breaches in all their manifestations in various regions of the world , examine the possibilities of :
( i ) Preventing human rights violations , especially the crime of torture , within the scope of the activities of the Committee ; and
( ii ) Increasing the resources of the United Nations budget allocated to human rights ;
( d ) In order to reach the goal of eradicating torture before the year 2000 , setting torture on the agenda for the World Conference and thereby creating a general awareness all over the world of torture as a threat to democracy ;
3 . Suggests that , within the framework of the World Conference , a meeting be convened with the participation of the Chairpersons and / or representatives of the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and the Chairpersons and / or representatives of each of the principal regional and other human rights organizations , including the African Commission on Human and People &apos;s Rights , the European Commission on Human Rights , the European Court of Human Rights , the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights , the Inter-American Court of Human Rights , the Committee on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations of the International Labour Organisation and the Committee on Conventions and Recommendations of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , to deal with the matters referred to ;
4 . Further suggests that the Preparatory Committee as well as the World Conference should explore the following broader issues :
( i ) The establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights ;
( ii ) The creation of an International Court for Human Rights ;
( iii ) The establishment of a Research Institute for Human Rights connected with the Centre for Human Rights of the United Nations ; and
( iv ) Cooperation and coordination with regional systems for the protection of human rights . &quot;
2 . Mr. BURNS proposed that the words &quot; Decides to appoint &quot; in paragraph 1 should be replaced by the word &quot; Appoints &quot; ; that the words &quot; inter alia &quot; should be inserted after the word &quot; including &quot; in paragraph 3 ; and that the roman numerals in brackets in paragraph 4 should read : ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) .
3 . It was so decided .
4 . Mr. EL IBRASHI said that the text of the comments and recommendations did not focus enough on the Committee &apos;s specific mandate , which related not only to torture , but also to other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or page
That point should be made more clearly .
The text should also make a clearer distinction between concerns of primary importance to the Committee and more general human rights problems .
5 . Mr. GIL LAVEDRA said that the text had very little substance , dealing in commonplaces or reiterating what was already known , its only significant recommendation being that States which had not yet done so should become parties to the Convention .
It was also hard to see how the multilateral meeting suggested in paragraph 3 would be organized .
The Committee should either make brief , practical recommendations relating directly to its mandate or none at all .
6 . Mr. LORENZO asked whether the text under consideration was addressed to the Preparatory Committee in connection with possible item for inclusion in the agenda of the World Conference or to the Conference itself in connection with its proceedings .
7 . The CHAIRMAN said that the Committee should be able to raise issues that were not directly within the framework of the Convention .
For example , if the Office of a High Commissioner for human rights was established , it would obviously have an impact on the Committee &apos;s work and the effectiveness of the Convention .
8 . Mrs. KLEIN ( Representative of the Secretary-General ) said that she agreed with the Chairman .
General Assembly resolution 45 / 155 set out the main objectives of the World Conference , one of which was to improve the effectiveness of the implementation mechanisms of the international treaty system .
All suggestions by the Committee , whether specific or general , would therefore be welcome and would be taken into account in preparing for the fourth meeting of the Preparatory Committee and the World Conference , but the Committee would probably not have enough time to prepare a full study of the topics for discussion which it chose .
9 . Mr. DIPANDA MOUELLE said he agreed with Mr. Gil Lavedra and Mr. El Ibrashi that the Committee should focus on the areas of greatest concern to it , but he did not think that other aspects should be left out if they helped improve human rights protection in general ; he had in mind the prevention and punishment of torture .
10 . Mr. SORENSEN said that he agreed with Mr. El Ibrashi on the need to focus on torture .
Paragraph 2 ( b ) was not devoid of content .
If the treaty bodies did not take a firm stance , their concerns would not be reflected in the agenda of the World Conference .
The Committee should therefore attempt to formulate concrete proposals .
11 . Mr. El Ibrashi &apos;s point about torture was well taken and he agreed that the wording of the Convention should be added in paragraph 2 ( c ) after the word &quot; torture &quot; .
12 . It was important to raise the matter of prevention , which had been neglected by other treaty bodies .
The reference to the need to increase resources was also justified .
13 . He was in favour of retaining paragraph 2 ( d ) because the Committee was the only treaty body that would propose that such an item should be included in the agenda of the World Conference .
If there was no cooperation among treaty bodies , there would be no results .
The Committee should therefore stress the need to improve the effectiveness of United Nations methods and mechanisms .
14 . Mr. LORENZO said he agreed with Mr. Dipanda Mouelle that the Committee should not limit itself to questions of torture .
Although the World Conference must consider torture as a matter of priority , it would also have other items on its agenda .
15 . He understood that some members wanted specific recommendations , but time was running short .
The Committee should therefore continue preparing for the World Conference and seek to ensure that topics of interest to it were included in the agenda of the World Conference .
The Committee would hold another session before the convening of the World Conference and it might spend a day on substantive issues , such as the relationship between a proposed high commissioner for human rights and the Committee .
It should produce a list of subjects of particular interest to it , but should not propose solutions .
16 . Mr. BURNS said that , although he had been a member of the working group , he was not committed to the substance of the text under consideration and had contributed nothing to it .
In fact , he had doubts about the entire enterprise .
17 . Mr. Gil Lavedra had objected that the text was not convincing and he could not agree more .
However , its purpose was simply to provide a list of topics that the Committee wanted to have placed on the agenda of the World Conference .
Some were specific to the Committee &apos;s activities and some were not . He agreed with Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Dipanda Mouelle that the Committee must work within a context : it could not confine itself to the narrow language of its mandate and assume that its activities did not intersect with those of other bodies .
18 . He suspected that there was a commonality of vague joint issues with the other treaty bodies because none of them had anything on the agenda .
For example , who knew whether the establishment of the Office of a high commissioner for human rights , as suggested in paragraph 4 ( a ) , would produce positive results ? How would it be defined , what would its jurisdiction be and how would it interact with other treaty bodies ?
If , however , the Committee succeeded in having that question included in the agenda , it would at least be discussed and that would be a step forward .
19 . He doubted that the members of the Committee sent to the World Conference would be able to submit a formal paper on specific issues .
He expected that the World Conference would produce a lot of talk , but nothing compelling or objective .
The problem was paragraph 3 of the text under consideration , which some members of the Committee apparently did not like .
The human rights treaty bodies and other organizations would probably spend time discussing issues of joint concern , and presumably something would emerge from those discussions .
He therefore accepted the criticism raised , but he did not see
20 . Mr. EL IBRASHI said that it was not his intention to exclude other topics , but to focus on torture .
He agreed with Mr. Gil Lavedra and Mr. Lorenzo that the Committee should submit concrete proposals or none at all .
There were a number of useful proposals that it could make , for example , with regard to issues of implementation .
Like Mr. Lorenzo , he thought that a working group should be established to prepare for the World Conference .
Clearly , the World Conference did not need to be told to consider possibilities for preventing human rights violations .
But the Committee might suggest raising the matter of Member States that had not yet acceded to the Convention or the question of articles 20 and 21 of the Convention .
Asking the World Conference to evaluate the effectiveness of United Nations methods and mechanisms was too vague .
He did not object to the reference to increasing the resources of the United Nations budget allocated to human rights , although that , too , was unnecessary .
The call to explore the establishment of a high commissioner for human rights and an international court for human rights was too general and had nothing to do with the Committee &apos;s work .
The Committee should establish a working group to prepare specific topics for the World Conference , which the Committee should not only attend , but also participate in actively .
21 . Mr. SORENSEN said that , at the second session of the Preparatory Committee , he had made a number of concrete proposals on the relationship between development , democracy and human rights , the treatment of torture victims , the role of education , etc . Mr. Burns had already visited Albania and he had been to Romania on behalf of the Committee .
The results of those visits might also be discussed , but they could not be included in the text under consideration , whose purpose was to have torture placed on the agenda of the World Conference .
If the text was to be shortened , he would propose that everything except the reference in paragraph 2 ( d ) to setting torture on the agenda for the World Conference in order to reach the goal of eradicating torture before the year 2000 should be deleted .
Now was not the proper time to discuss what concrete points should be recommended or raised at the World Conference .
22 . Mr. GIL LAVEDRA said that he agreed with Mr. Sorensen .
A text had been prepared and the Committee should avoid becoming bogged down .
Torture was at the heart of its work and it would not be useful for the Committee to discuss other matters .
23 . Paragraph 2 ( a ) contained a specific recommendation that would improve the operation of the Convention .
The recommendation in paragraph 2 ( b ) was repetitious because the General Assembly had already had those objectives in mind when it had decided to convene the World Conference .
Paragraph 2 ( c ) and paragraph 2 ( c ) ( ii ) could be combined because the rise of ethnic violence could be linked to a request for more resources .
The disintegration of political systems in recent years had led in some cases to conflicts and irrational violence had called into question the very goals of the United Nations , and it was therefore reasonable to request an increase in the resources of the United Nations budget allocated to human rights .
He had no objection to paragraph 2 ( d ) , as long as it was clear that it did not contain a recommendation that had emerged from the Committee &apos;s work .
He was not opposed to paragraph 3 , but , as those human rights bodies were each part of a different system , he did not think that discussions with them would serve any purpose .
Paragraph 4 merely repeated what other committees had already suggested and , in his view , the Committee should simply propose that those issues should be placed on the agenda of the World Conference for discussion .
24 . The CHAIRMAN said that he could have supported the text as it stood , since , in his view , repeating recommendations made by other bodies could only strengthen it .
He agreed that some points might be made more specific , but that should be done in the Preparatory Committee rather than in the Committee &apos;s draft recommendations .
He had the impression that Mr. El Ibrashi and Mr. Gil Lavedra would have liked the text to be completely redrafted , but Mr. Gil Lavedra had now said that if paragraph 2 ( b ) could be shortened , he could accept the remainder .
If Mr. El Ibrashi agreed to that proposal , the Committee &apos;s representative in the Preparatory Committee could be requested at the next session to present the points in greater detail when the Preparatory Committee met in April 1993 .
He suggested that Mr. Gil Lavedra might prepare an appropriate text during a short break in the meeting .
26 . Mr. MIKHAILOV said that , when proposing the establishment of the working group that had prepared the original text , he had intended that it should concentrate on questions that were specific to the Committee rather than on general questions , but too much time had been spent in discussing the title and there had been no opportunity to consider the substantive questions .
He agreed with the criticism which had been made by Mr. El Ibrashi and Mr. Gil Lavedra and could be taken into account at the Committee &apos;s next session and at the next meeting of the Preparatory Committee .
Meanwhile , the text should be accepted as a working document , with its heading amended to read : &quot; recommendations and suggestions ... &quot; .
27 . Following a brief discussion in which Mr. EL IBRASHI and Mr. GIL LAVEDRA took part , The CHAIRMAN said that , if there was no objection , he would take it that the Committee decided to establish a working group , composed of Mr. Gil Lavedra , Mr. Burns and himself , to prepare an amended text .
28 . It was so decided .
The meeting was suspended at 11.40 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon
29 . The CHAIRMAN said that the working group had produced a compromise text which he commended for the Committee &apos;s consideration .
It was an improvement on the original text , even though he could have accepted that version as it stood .
30 . Mr. BURNS said that the revised text was entitled : &quot; Recommendations by the Committee Against Torture to the Preparatory Committee of the World Conference as well as to the Conference itself &quot; and read :
1 . Appoints Mr. Sorensen as representative and Mr. Mikhailov as alternate to the meetings of the Preparatory Committee of the World Conference on Human Rights ,
( a ) With a view to eradicating torture by the year 2000 , that subject matter should be included in the agenda of the World Conference .
( b ) An energetic and concerted effort should be made both during the process of preparation for the World Conference and at the Conference itself to encourage :
( ii ) Those States parties to the Convention which have not done so to declare in favour of the provisions of articles 20 , 21 and 22 .
( b ) In view of the unfortunate rise of ethnic violence , torture and other human rights breaches in all their manifestations in various regions of the world , examine the possibilities of :
( i ) Preventing human rights violations , especially the crimes of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , within the scope of the activities of the Committee ; and
3 . Would welcome the opportunity within the framework of the World Conference for a meeting to be convened with the participation of the Chairpersons and / or representatives of the United Nations human rights treaty bodies and the Chairpersons and / or representatives of each of the principal regional and other human rights organizations to deal with the matters referred to .
4 . Would also welcome the Preparatory Committee as well as the World Conference exploring the following broader issues :
( a ) The establishment of a High Commissioner for Human Rights ;
( b ) The creation of an International Court for Human Rights ;
( c ) The establishment of a Research Intitute for Human Rights connected with the Centre for Human Rights of the United Nations ; and
( d ) Cooperation and coordination with regional systems for the protection of human rights .
Suggests that with a view to improving the implementation of existing human rights standards and instruments , the following topics should be considered as appropriate ones for inclusion by the World Conference in its agenda :
( a ) An examination of the issues relevant to the implementation of the Convention against Torture ;
( b ) An evaluation of the effectiveness of United Nations methods and mechanisms ; and
( c ) A formulation of concrete recommendations for improving the effectiveness of United Nations mechanisms ( especially the functioning of the Convention against Torture ) aimed at promoting , encouraging and monitoring respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms . &quot;
31 . The CHAIRMAN said that the preambular paragraph should read : &quot; Pursuant to paragraphs 9 and 10 of General Assembly resolution 45 / 155 ... &quot; .
32 . The revised text of the recommendations was adopted .
33 . The CHAIRMAN said that the Under-Secretary-General for Human Rights had informed Mr. El Ibrashi that he would do everything possible to obtain the necessary funds to enable one member of the Committee in each case to attend the San José and Bangkok regional meetings .
If such funds became available , he suggested that Mr. Sorensen might go to San José and Mr. El Ibrashi to Bangkok .
34 . Mr. BURNS said that it would be preferable both from the linguistic viewpoint and in the interest of the efficient use of resources for each meeting to be attended by a member from the area in question .
35 . Mr. SORENSEN said that he had been about to make the same suggestion . He could support the candidacy of either Mr. Gil Lavedra or Mr. Lorenzo for the San José regional meeting .
36 . Mr. BURNS said that there was no reason why Mr. Sorensen should not also attend if he could pay his way .
37 . Mr. GIL LAVEDRA said he agreed that the selection should be made on a geographical basis .
If the necessary funds could be provided , he would support Mr. Lorenzo &apos;s appointment .
He also supported the suggestion that Mr. El Ibrashi should attend the Bangkok regional conference .
38 . Mr. MIKHAILOV said he agreed that Mr. El Ibrashi should represent the Committee at the Bangkok regional meeting .
He proposed that Mr. Gil Lavedra should be the Committee &apos;s representative at the meeting in San José and , if there were enough resources for a second person , that Mr. Lorenzo should also attend .
Although such decisions were subject to the resources made available , he believed that the Committee had decided that Mr. Sorensen should attend if the Danish Government paid his expenses .
39 . The CHAIRMAN said he had understood that Mr. Gil Lavedra had prior commitments and was therefore unable to attend .
He should therefore be replaced by Mr. Lorenzo .
40 . Mr. LORENZO said that , if other financial resources could be found , Mr. Sorensen &apos;s attendance at the San José meeting would be welcomed .
41 . Mr. EL IBRASHI reminded the Committee that resources would be provided for only one representative of the Committee at each regional meeting .
42 . The CHAIRMAN said that , if there was no objection , he would take it that the Committee decided that Mr. Lorenzo should represent it at the meeting in San José if funds were made available by the Centre for Human Rights ; that Mr. Sorensen would be welcome to attend if he could pay his own way or extra funds were provided by the Centre ; and that Mr. El Ibrashi should attend the meeting in Bangkok .
If funds were not provided , no one would attend any of the meetings .
43 . It was so decided .
ORGANIZATIONAL AND OTHER MATTERS ( agenda item 2 ) ( continued )
Working methods of the Committee
44 . The CHAIRMAN requested the Secretariat to prepare a report which would provide information on the working methods of other Committees and give the Committee general ideas on how it could improve its work .
45 . Some human rights Committees had working groups which drew up and submitted questions to Governments .
The advantage of that system was that questions tended to be more systematic and Governments were able to take their time and give detailed replies .
The system would be worth looking at in relation to the work of the Committee , which , unlike other Committees , did not adopt general comments or recommendations .
Perhaps it should decide to do so .
46 . In addition , the Secretariat might start keeping files containing information on the human rights situation in each State party , including any incidents of torture .
The Committee might also discuss questions of principle , such as the way in which the death penalty was carried out in some States parties .
47 . The Committee had managed to speed up procedures with regard to communications as a result of the appointment of country rapporteurs , but other methods , including those used by the Human Rights Committee , could be adopted and he requested the Secretariat to provide information on them .
In his view , the Committee &apos;s reports were too long and repeated information contained in the summary records , which gave a clear and accurate picture of what happened in meetings .
The Committee should therefore consider the possibility of reducing the length of its reports ; that would also make them more readable and accessible .
48 . Since some members of the Committee had not received documentation for the session on time , he suggested that the Secretariat might make use of special postal and delivery services .
49 . Mr. SORENSEN said that he agreed with the comments and suggestions made by the Chairman and hoped that the Secretariat would be in a position to provide information on other human rights bodies as quickly as possible .
He supported the idea that the Committee should adopt general comments and recommendations .
He also proposed that , at the end of each session , it should decide what it would discuss at its next session and that a member of the Committee should be requested to prepare a paper on a particular topic .
Information should be made available to the members of the Committee on what torture might involve , since , according to article 20 of the Convention , they could be called on to take part in fact-finding missions .
Information on the work of other human rights bodies
50 . Mr. SORENSEN said that , as a result of discussions in the context of the Preparatory Committee for the World Conference on Human Rights , he had realized that there were advantages to cooperation between United Nations treaty bodies .
For example , he had found the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to be quite interesting and had particularly welcomed the suggestion made in its report that the Convention on the Rights of the Child should be translated into as many languages as possible , preferably all the languages of the States parties .
That might be a useful step with regard to the Convention against Torture as well .
The Committee on the Rights of the Child had also suggested that some kind of computerized database should be established in the Centre for Human Rights to keep country files , which would be helpful to all human rights treaty bodies .
That Committee held two two-week sessions a year and had decided to deal with the reports of States parties over a period of two days , but , as there were already 120 signatories to the Convention , that might be rather ambitious .
51 . The CHAIRMAN , speaking as a member of the Committee , said that the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women held one two-week session each year and had a five-member pre-sessional working group which prepared questions for Governments , although the members of the Committee were , of course , free to ask further questions during the session .
The Committee often did not have enough time to complete its work and it had fallen behind in the consideration of reports . It had therefore asked for funds so that it might hold two sessions a year starting 1993 .
Unlike the Committee against Torture , it was not involved in activities such as fact-finding missions and the consideration of communications and it dealt only with reports submitted by State parties .
It had no Country or Alternate Country Rapporteurs ; the Chairperson made concluding comments after a delegation had answered the Committee &apos;s questions .
The Committee &apos;s activities covered discrimination against women in all areas and , unlike the Committee against Torture , it adopted general decisions and recommendations which were submitted to all States parties .
52 . The CHAIRMAN said that , because of the shortage of time , Mr. El Ibrashi &apos;s report on the work of the Human Rights Committee would be the first item on the agenda of the spring session of the Committee against Torture .
CLOSURE OF THE SESSION
53 . After the customary exchange of courtesies , the CHAIRMAN declared the session closed .
The meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.

The resumed public meeting was called to order at 4.35 p.m.
CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS SUBMITTED BY STATES PARTIES UNDER ARTICLE 19 OF THE CONVENTION ( agenda item 4 ) ( continued )
Supplementary report of Spain ( continued ) ( CAT / C / 17 / Add.10 )
1 . At the invitation of the Chairman , Mr. Borrega Borrega ( Spain ) took a place at the Committee table .
2 . Mr. GIL LAVEDRA ( Country Rapporteur ) read out the Committee &apos;s conclusions regarding the supplementary report of Spain . The text would read :
&quot; The Committee has given careful consideration to the first supplementary report of the Kingdom of Spain and has heard with interest the excellent replies provided by the representative of the Government .
&quot; The Committee reiterates the concerns which it expressed when it considered the initial report , particularly regarding the need for all the offences specified in article 5 of the Convention to be punished with equal vigour , and the desirability of general application of the procedural standards relating to the holding of persons incommunicado and to the choice of a trustworthy counsel .
&quot; The Committee likewise expresses its concern at the increase in the number of complaints of torture and ill-treatment , at delays in the processing of such complaints and at the impunity of a number of perpetrators of torture .
&quot; In conclusion , the Committee welcomes the cooperation of the Kingdom of Spain and expresses its confidence in the measures which will certainly be adopted to improve compliance with the Convention . &quot;
3 . The CHAIRMAN said that the Committee &apos;s conclusions would be duly communicated to the Government of Spain .
4 . Mr. Borrega Borrega ( Spain ) withdrew .
Supplementary report of China ( continued ) ( CAT / C / 7 / Add.14 )
5 . At the invitation of the Chairman , Mr. Jin Yongjian , Mr. Liao Jincheng , Mr. Zhang Yishan , Mr. Chen Weidian , Mr. Zhang Jun , Mr. Hao Chiyong , Mr. Li Yugian , Mr. Shen Yongxiang , Mr. Liu Zhenmin and Ms. Li Linmei took seats at the Committee table .
6 . Mr. JIN Yongjian ( China ) , replying to questions raised in the course of consideration of his country &apos;s report , said that Mr. Ben Ammar had asked about trade unions in China .
He was able to inform him that , under Chinese legislation , trade unions had the status of people &apos;s organizations .
Mr. Ben Ammar had also inquired about the distinction between exemption from prosecution and non-suit .
In the former case , the offence did not merit prosecution , whereas in the latter culpability was not in question .
7 . Mr. Ben Ammar and Mr. El Ibrashi had asked whether China would reconsider its reservations to the Convention .
Reconsideration was already under way in the case of article 30 , and the Committee &apos;s views regarding article 20 would be duly taken account .
8 . Concerning legislative measures to prevent torture , he said that information on the code of conduct for law-enforcement officials and on the administration of public security in general would be submitted in his country &apos;s next report .
New regulations regarding detention centres had recently been introduced , and guidelines for judges and public prosecutors were under review , as was the issue of amendments to the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure .
Developments concerning that aspect of the law in China would be duly reported .
9 . The employment of judges and public prosecutors - an issue raised by Mr. Gil Lavedra - was the responsibility of the Government , as was their dismissal in the event of misconduct .
The procuratorate was responsible for investigating allegations of torture in which officials of the State might be involved .
10 . Referring to the question raised by the Chairman , he said that paragraph 107 of his country &apos;s supplementary report ( CAT / C / 7 / Add.14 ) referred to crimes against the rights of citizens , whereas paragraph 108 referred solely to offences involving torture .
11 . It had also been asked whether a State body would take action even in the absence of a complaint .
If a case of torture was discovered , the Ministry responsible for supervising the civil authorities would take action , if necessary by initiating proceedings .
12 . Mr. Burns and other members of the Committee had asked at what stage defendants were entitled to contact their families or lawyers .
Under Chinese law , families of defendants were normally notified of the fact and place of detention , unless accessories to the alleged offence were still at large .
Persons who were arrested must be informed of the nature of the charges at the time of arrest .
With regard to pre-trial detention , defendants retained their rights , and those officials responsible for torture were liable to prosecution .
Once the decision to prefer charges was taken , the defendant normally had one month &apos;s notice of the offence with which he was charged , but his lawyers were entitled to an extension of that period if they considered it insufficient .
13 . China was currently drafting legislation on the question of extradition , and had signed bilateral agreements with a number of countries on reciprocal arrangements in commercial and judicial matters , including extradition .
Any extradition order must comply with the basic principles of international law , including the provisions of the Convention .
The country concerned must first submit a request , through the diplomatic channel , accompanied by the relevant documentation , including a copy of the arrest warrant .
Responsibility for page expulsion or refoulement lay with various bodies , according to the offence involved , and implementation of an extradition order was the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Security .
If not extradited , a citizen of another State would be tried under the provisions of China &apos;s Penal Code .
14 . With regard to another issue raised by Mr. Burns , he said that the procuratorate was the legal monitoring organ of the State and was entrusted with the task of ensuring consistent application of the law .
It was entitled to investigate any criminal case brought to its notice and to inquire into serious criminal charges , as well as the conduct of the police and security organs .
It was also empowered to conduct proceedings against the authorities , when such action had been initiated , and to review the legality of decisions handed down by courts of law , in addition to inspecting conditions in prisons and other penitentiary institutions .
A training scheme for members of the procuratorate had already been set up .
15 . Superior orders could not be invoked to extenuate offences involving torture , and administrative and criminal procedures were available in such cases .
Torture as such was defined in China &apos;s Penal Code as a criminal activity .
In connection with articles 22 and 26 of the Convention , he wished to point out that those provisions applied also to the armed forces .
16 . Reform through education and labour in China was carried out in accordance with an Act approved by the Standing Committee of the National People &apos;s Congress in 1957 .
The measure was intended to reduce crime and to safeguard the public .
It did not entail punishment , but was intended to restrain potential juvenile offenders , particularly in urban areas .
The terms of sentence were between one and three years , but the primary aim was rehabilitation through persuasion and education , and the rate of recidivism was under 7 per cent .
17 . Members of the Committee had asked questions about administrative detention , which in China was also known as public security detention and was the penalty imposed by public security organs for minor offences , such as a breach of the peace .
Offenders could be held for periods of 1 to 15 days .
Appeals against decisions taken by public security organs must be lodged within five days of arrest and dealt with within a further five days .
Any subsequent appeals were lodged with the people &apos;s courts .
Public security officials were strictly forbidden to beat , curse , humiliate or otherwise intimidate detainees , and any failure to comply with those standards of behaviour was punishable by law .
18 . On the question of serious offences ( offences punishable by more than five years &apos; imprisonment ) , according to the President of the People &apos;s Supreme Court , during the preceding five years 2,438,217 persons had been charged with an offence , serious offences accounting for 34.9 per cent of that figure .
In 1992 , 171,424 persons had been found guilty of serious offences , which represented 34.6 per cent of the 495,264 persons sentenced .
19 . With regard to Mr. Burns &apos; question concerning the death penalty , it should be noted that capital punishment was reserved for persons who had committed only the most heinous crimes and its application was subject to extremely strict conditions .
Furthermore , his question whether a two-year stay of execution could be considered as inhuman treatment was completely unfounded in that the convicted person was given time to repent .
During the two years , he was subjected to reform through labour and his conduct was monitored for signs of successful rehabilitation .
The death penalty could be commuted to a life sentence or a fixed-term sentence .
The death penalty was carried out only in exceptional cases in which offenders resolutely refused to reform or committed further serious crimes whilst in prison .
Over the years the system had proved an effective way of controlling serious crime .
20 . In response to the question concerning the use of organs taken from the bodies of persons executed , it should be pointed out that the removal of organs without the prior permission of either the person himself or his family was not standard practice .
However , there were cases in which permission had been given and the organs were duly removed and donated to patients .
21 . In reply to the questions concerning counter-revolutionary and political offences , he said there were no specific provisions covering such offences .
The concept of a political crime did not exist in China , since persons were fully entitled to hold views which differed from those of the Government or the State .
The crimes of counter-revolution referred to in the Penal Code were not political crimes but a category of criminal offences .
Counter-revolutionary crimes included all activities carried out with the specific intention of subverting State power or overthrowing the Government , as clearly defined in articles 91 to 102 of the Penal Code .
The judicial bodies which tried counter-revolutionary cases showed particular circumspection and the courts strictly abided by the principles and procedures laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure .
22 . It was necessary to draw the Committee &apos;s attention to the fact that a great deal of the material cited by its members had been supplied by non-governmental organizations , some of which were particularly biased against China .
The credibility of such material was therefore questionable .
The report of the Special Rapporteur on questions of torture mentioned by members of the Committee had used exactly the same sources of information and should be treated with equal caution .
23 . China was making valiant efforts to improve its legal system and promote democracy .
Any violations of the Convention against Torture were merely isolated cases and were not representative of the policy of the Government of China .
24 . The CHAIRMAN thanked the Chinese delegation for its detailed replies to questions asked by members of the Committee and announced that the Committee would hold a closed meeting to discuss its conclusions and recommendations .
25 . Mr. Jin Yongjian , Mr. Liao Jincheng , Mr. Zhang Yishan , Mr. Chen Weidian , Mr. Zhang Jun , Mr. Hao Chiyong , Mr. Li Yuqian , Mr. Shen Yongxiang , Mr. Liu Zhenmin and Ms. Li Linmei ( China ) withdrew .
The resumed public meeting rose at 5.45 p.m.

The meeting was called to order at 10.20 a.m.
CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS SUBMITTED BY STATES PARTIES UNDER ARTICLE 40 OF THE COVENANT ( agenda item 4 ) ( continued )
Second periodic report of the Islamic Republic of Iran ( CCPR / C / 28 / Add.15 )
1 . At the invitation of the Chairman , Mr. Mehrpour , Mr. Hussaini , Mr. Tahsildoost and Mr. Nasseri ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) took places at the Committee table .
2 . Mr. MEHRPOUR ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) , introducing his country &apos;s second periodic report ( CCPR / C / 28 / Add.15 ) , said that he appreciated the opportunity to appear before the Committee and would welcome its constructive comments .
3 . The adoption of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights had represented one of the most important steps towards the recognition of the dignity and honour of the human being , and its observance could play a significant role in establishing justice and peace .
Despite the difficulties arising from the diversity of cultures , practices and traditions of various countries , the signatory Governments had made great efforts to fulfil the requirements of the Covenant and to prepare the periodic reports called for .
The main objective of the Covenant was to secure recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family and a realization by the individual of his duties to others and to the community to which he belonged , with a view to establishing justice and eliminating tyranny and discrimination .
4 . Among the important principles laid down in the Covenant were the rights to life , freedom from slavery , freedom of thought , conscience and religion , freedom of expression and equality before the law - provided for in articles 6 , 8 , 18 , 19 and 26 .
The various means prescribed for preventing any violation of those rights included the principles of presumption of innocence , the non-retroactivity of the law , the right to a fair trial , the right to a defence counsel , the prohibition of torture and the right to appeal .
5 . The Covenant was a valuable international instrument whose correct enforcement could help to preserve the inherent value and dignity of human beings .
That was the fundamental basis of his country &apos;s order .
The right to life was among its most respected principles and those of the Islamic religion on which it was based .
Article 1 of the Constitution laid down that the form of government of Iran was that of an Islamic Republic , endorsed by the people of Iran on the basis of their long-standing belief in the sovereignty of truth and Qur &apos;anic justice .
Many references were made in the Qur &apos;an to respect for the right to life , and the violation of that principle was considered a grave sin .
The Qur &apos;an forbade the taking of life other than in retribution for murder , in accordance with justice .
In cases of premeditated murder , it stated that the killer must be subject to execution , but that the victim &apos;s family should be encouraged to show clemency .
6 . Freedom of thought , conviction and expression were fully respected .
Article 23 of the Constitution laid down that the investigation of individuals &apos; beliefs was forbidden and no one could be molested or taken to task simply for holding a certain belief .
Article 24 provided that publications and the press had freedom of expression except when that was detrimental to the fundamental principles of Islam or the rights of the public .
Islam was a major advocate of freedom of thought , and in many of its suras , the Qur &apos;an invited people to think freely and not to follow blindly the narrow thinking of their forefathers , to use their powers of thought and wisdom , to listen to everything , to evaluate the logic of others and to express their feelings freely .
No compulsion was exercised on people with respect to their religious convictions .
The limitations of freedom of expression and ideas in Islamic law and in the Constitution were only as provided for in the Covenant .
For example , article 19 ( 3 ) of the Covenant stipulated that the exercise of the right to freedom of expression could be subject to certain restrictions necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others and for the protection of national security or of public order or of public health or morals ; while article 18 ( 3 ) stated that freedom to manifest one &apos;s religion or beliefs could be subject only to such limitations as were prescribed by law and were necessary to protect public safety , order , health or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others .
In articles 21 and 22 , similar restrictions were placed on the right of peaceful assembly and the right to freedom of association with others .
The restrictions on freedom of expression of publications and the press and on the formation of parties , societies , political or professional associations and religious societies , laid down in articles 24 and 26 of the Constitution , were of the same order .
In an Islamic country , protection of Islamic morals was in line with the protection of public morals allowed as a restriction in the Covenant .
The methods provided for in the Covenant in order to guarantee the enjoyment of the rights in question had been accepted in principle in the Islamic Republic of Iran and every effort was being made to apply them .
page 7 . The right to presumption of innocence , a fair trial and the services of a defence counsel were among the recognized and established rights of Islam and had been prescribed in the Constitution and laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran .
The relevant provisions could be found in articles 32-42 of the Constitution .
8 . The Covenant was thus respected in the Islamic Republic of Iran , whose objective of establishing justice , equity , political and economic freedom , solidarity among nations and avoidance of tyranny was based on the will of the people .
From its inception , the Islamic Republic had made every effort to set up the necessary institutions to that end and make good the shortcomings that had existed before the Revolution .
The people had approved the Constitution through a democratic vote .
The country and its people had , for eight years , unhappily been subjected to a cruel war which had had devastating effects and caused irreparable damage .
The authorities had made every effort to restore the institutions that had existed prior to the war and enforce the provisions of the Constitution .
A number of parliamentary , presidential and other elections and referendums had been held and there had been spectacular popular participation in the country &apos;s efforts .
The judicial order had been reorganized and steady progress was being achieved in improving the performance of the legal system and the protection of people &apos;s rights .
The judicial power at present comprised the General Prosecutor &apos;s Office , the Revolutionary Prosecutor &apos;s Office , two civil courts , two penal courts , a revolutionary court , a special civil court and , in accordance with article 172 of the Constitution , a special military court and a military prosecutor .
In the civil and penal courts , Court No. 1 would in each case deal with more serious offences and Court No. 2 with less serious offences .
Decisions taken in the lower courts could be appealed against in the higher courts .
There was a special court to deal with such matters as marriage , divorce and inheritance .
The Supreme Court was at the head of the judicial power .
It was the ultimate body of appeal and was responsible for ensuring equality in the dispensing of justice .
It had more than 30 chambers , all comprising experienced judges and jurists .
Article 35 of the Constitution provided that both parties to a lawsuit had the right in all courts of law to select an attorney , and if they were unable to do so arrangements must be made to provide them with legal counsel .
If a court refused to accept a counsel , that court &apos;s judgement would be annulled by the Supreme Court and the judge would be subject to disciplinary action .
There had been some cases of the kind in which the judgement had been overturned and a retrial had been ordered when the services of an attorney were available .
In cases related to offences punishable by a life sentence or capital punishment , the presence of a counsel was obligatory whether or not the defendant wanted one .
Any judgement in a proceeding where that provision was not respected would be overturned by the Supreme Court .
In a recent case , the Legal Office of the judicial power had expressed the opinion that an accused person before the Revolutionary Court could have the services of a counsel even though there was no special law providing for such services in that court .
Other provisions establishing justice and equity in the defence of accused persons were described in the report .
Judges were chosen by the judicial power according to their competence .
Anyone applying for such a post must hold a law degree from a faculty of law in the Islamic Republic or must have undergone certain legal and theological training and have passed appropriate examinations .
There was a special disciplinary court before which judges could be brought if a complaint was made against them .
There was also a court of administrative justice , established under article 173 of the Constitution to investigate the complaints , grievances and objections of the people with respect to government officials , organs and statutes ; and , under article 174 , a national general inspectorate to supervise the proper conduct of affairs and the correct implementation of laws by the administrative organs of the Government .
It now had more than 20 chambers .
9 . As could be seen from the report , the Iranian Senate had ratified the Covenant on 27 April 1975 .
A short introductory report had been provided by the former regime in August 1977 , and following the triumph of the Islamic Revolution , its initial report had been submitted in July 1982 .
The submission of the second periodic report had been delayed by the war .
Following the cessation of hostilities , the Islamic Republic had entered into close cooperation with the United Nations on human rights matters , particularly with respect to the Covenant .
A number of human rights seminars had been convened in the country with the Government &apos;s active participation , and there had been many useful discussions and exchanges .
10 . There was a human rights office within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which , among a great many other activities , was involved in the convening of meetings for discussion , from the scientific , theological and intellectual standpoints of issues relating to human rights .
The Covenant had been on the agenda at such meetings .
Articles relating to human rights had appeared in a periodical published by the Ministry of Justice , and the Farsi text of the Covenant had recently been issued in that publication .
11 . A course on human rights was given in the Faculty of Law .
Trainees preparing to enter service in the Justice Department took a course on the Covenant .
Experts from the Committee were surely aware , as some of them had participated in it , that a course on advisory and technical services in human rights had been conducted in 1992 in the Islamic Republic of Iran .
12 . The second periodic report that was now before the Committee had been prepared by a number of eminent jurists and judges .
All the articles in the Covenant were touched on and information was provided on legislation , law enforcement and a number of other matters .
Numerous provisions of the Constitution , domestic legislation and jurisprudence were covered .
13 . The Islamic Republic of Iran consistently endeavoured to implement the Covenant &apos;s principles and thereby to attain social justice .
If any violations were committed by the authorities , efforts were made to put an end to them .
In view of the Committee &apos;s mission in the field of human rights , his Government would welcome its opinions and assistance .
14 . The CHAIRMAN thanked the Iranian delegation for its introduction and invited it to reply to the questions in section I of the list of issues relating to the second periodic report , which read :
&quot; I. Constitutional and legal framework within which the Covenant is implemented ; state of emergency ; non-discrimination and equality of the sexes ( arts . 2 , 3 , 4 and 26 )
( a ) Please clarify the status of the Covenant within the Iranian legal system , particularly whether individuals can invoke the provisions of the Covenant directly before the courts .
( b ) How can a conflict that may arise between the provisions of the Covenant and Islamic law be resolved ?
In view of the statement made by the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran during the consideration of the initial report , has there been a general review undertaken of the compatibility of the provisions of the Covenant with Islamic law ?
( c ) Has the Guardian Council , provided for under article 91 of the Constitution , had the opportunity to pronounce itself on the compatibility of the legislation with Islam and what have been its decisions concerning human rights ?
( d ) Please comment on the compatibility with articles 2 ( 1 ) and 26 of the Covenant of the provisions in articles 3 and 20 of the Constitution providing for the equal protection under the law of all citizens of the country , in conformity with Islamic criteria .
( e ) Please provide further information , including relevant statistical data , concerning the participation of women in the political and economic life of the country ( para . 42 of the report ) .
( f ) Please clarify the application in practice of legal provisions relating to the dowry system as well as on their conformity with articles 2 , 3 and 26 of the Covenant .
( g ) Please comment on the impact of article 2 , paragraph 1 , of the Constitution upon the provisions of article 26 of the Covenant in respect of all the citizens of the Islamic Republic of Iran .
( h ) In which respects , other than in the exercise of political rights , are the rights of aliens restricted as compared with those of citizens ?
( i ) Please provide information on the law and practice relating to the employment of minors . &quot;
15 . Mr. MEHRPOUR ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) , referring to paragraph ( a ) , said articles 77 and 125 of the Constitution indicated that treaties , agreements and other international instruments must be approved and ratified by Parliament .
After ratification , such an instrument passed into law , in conformity with article 9 of the Civil Code .
Since the Covenant had been ratified in Parliament , it had become an integral part of the body of law in the Islamic Republic of Iran .
It had the same validity as other domestic legislation and was enforced as such .
Many of the general principles set out in the Covenant had in fact already been reflected in Iranian legislation .
16 . As to whether individuals could directly invoke the Covenant and courts could issue rulings on the basis of the Covenant , he said no jurisprudence existed in that matter .
It should be noted , however , that the Legal Department of the judiciary , which elucidated matters that might be unclear to judges and jurists , especially young ones , had given an advisory opinion to the effect that there would be no difficulty involved in invoking the Covenant before the courts .
17 . Referring to paragraph ( b ) , he said that since the Covenant was part of the law in the Islamic Republic of Iran , having been ratified in Parliament , it was unlikely that a conflict would arise between it and other instruments of domestic law .
If one did , however , the conflict would be resolved in accordance with domestic legislation .
No jurisprudence existed on such matters .
18 . In answer to the question in paragraph ( c ) on the Guardian Council , he said that it had not yet handed down any decision dealing specifically with human rights , but in all decisions reflected a regard for the freedom and equality of the individual before the law and the need to avoid any form of discrimination .
The Guardian Council &apos;s duties were to scrutinize the laws passed by the Parliament to ensure that they did not infringe the principles of the Constitution .
19 . In response to the question in paragraph ( d ) , he referred members of the Committee to paragraphs 41-48 of the report , which gave a full explanation of the subject .
His Government saw no conflict between the Covenant and articles 3 and 20 of the Constitution .
20 . Turning to paragraph ( e ) , he said the scope of women &apos;s activities in social , political and economic affairs had been expanding notably .
Statistics showed a speedy increase in the presence of women at all levels and in all areas of society .
A number of bodies were actively engaged in efforts to improve the status of women .
A women &apos;s cultural and social council had prepared a charter of women &apos;s rights .
Family committees met once a week to review legislation and make proposals .
A presidential adviser on women &apos;s issues had been appointed .
Women were active in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
In the most recent parliamentary elections , 90 women candidates had stood for office and nine of them had been elected .
The number of women candidates had been far greater than ever before , and the nine women elected compared favourably with the total of four who had previously held seats in Parliament .
All nine had been elected with a strong majority and in the first round , even though many of them had been seeking to represent highly traditional and religiously oriented districts .
Many women had been involved in supervising the conduct of the elections .
21 . In the numerous publications on the subject of women &apos;s rights , a wide variety of issues were discussed .
A total of 443,840 women were employed in the various ministries , government offices and departments .
Of that number , 45 per cent were directors of offices or departments .
Twenty-five per cent of all attorneys were women , and there were many women doctors and graduates of higher educational institutions .
22 . With respect to the question in paragraph ( f ) on the dowry system described in paragraph 45 of the report , he said that in accordance with the Civil Code , the dowry was a monetary contribution in a specific amount given to the wife by her husband at the time of marriage .
The amount was determined by mutual agreement : both parties had to be satisfied .
The wife could demand payment of the dowry in full at any time following her marriage .
The system existed in all Islamic countries and represented a form of protection and security for women and a way of establishing financial equality between men and women .
Other measures to ensure protection for women included a law recently passed by Parliament that incorporated social security rights for widows and divorced women .
23 . As to the question in paragraph ( g ) , he said Muslims believed that sovereignty over the entire world was exercised only by God .
All individuals , irrespective of their race or sex , were flowers in the garden of humanity and were entitled to respect .
The monotheism practised in the Islamic Republic of Iran was in no way in conflict with the principles of human rights .
From the Islamic point of view , the most respected people in the eyes of God were those who were pious , observing abstinence and honouring human rights .
The fact of belonging to a particular religion , race or ethnic group did not bestow any privilege .
24 . With regard to paragraph ( h ) of the list , he said that his country &apos;s legislation contained certain restrictions with regard to foreigners .
For example , under article 81 of the Constitution , it was prohibited to grant concessions to foreigners for the formation of companies or institutions dealing with commerce , industry , agriculture or mining .
Under article 82 of the Constitution , the employment of foreign experts was forbidden , except in case of necessity and with the approval of the Islamic Consultative Assembly .
25 . There were also certain stipulations with regard to ownership rights .
If a foreigner wished to buy real estate , he had to request permission to do so .
If he subsequently left the country , he had to sell the property .
If he was unable to do so before leaving the country , the property would be sold by the State to the highest bidder and the money handed over to the previous owner .
26 . Referring to paragraph ( i ) , he said that the employment of persons under 15 years of age was forbidden under his country &apos;s labour legislation .
Employers could employ adolescents provided that they observed certain regulations designed to protect the rights of the youths .
For example , prior to being employed , a youth had to be examined by a doctor , who had to give his views concerning the suitability of the type of work proposed .
If the doctor considered it inappropriate for the youth , the employer had to provide a different kind of employment .
Under the Labour Act , adolescents were prohibited from performing dangerous work .
Any work that might inflict physical or moral damage must be performed by persons above 18 years of age .
27 . Mr. SADI welcomed the Iranian delegation and urged it to view the dialogue with members as a two-way street that would enable the delegation to learn from the Committee and vice versa .
28 . The report of the Islamic Republic of Iran contained a considerable amount of information .
However , he wished to emphasize that the central point was the status of the Covenant in the Islamic Republic .
The main concern of members was whether the Covenant might come into conflict with Islam .
It was well known that Islam was a merciful and compassionate religion .
However , in modern times , the image of Islam had been distorted and had caused the non-Muslim world to view Islam as isolated from its true nature .
The Covenant was not a perfect instrument . However , it had been formulated and adopted with the help of many countries , including Muslim nations , and had to be accepted as it was .
29 . The delegation had said that the Covenant had become the law of the land .
He would like to know how that could be the case since the Covenant could not be invoked in the Iranian courts .
In his opinion , the Government must do more to ensure that information on the Covenant was disseminated on a greater scale in the country .
The Islamic Republic of Iran had ratified the Covenant and had therefore become accountable .
If no jurisprudence existed in the country in connection with the Covenant , that perhaps meant that the Covenant had yet to be given its due in Iranian legislation .
He referred to article 2 ( 2 ) of the Covenant and said that the Islamic Republic still had to take that additional step .
Islam was exemplary in the human rights field and Iran could easily meet its obligations under the Covenant .
30 . Mr. EL SHAFEI welcomed the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the Committee and noted that it was the second time that an Iranian delegation was taking part in a dialogue under article 40 of the Covenant .
He commended the delegation on the report , which had been prepared in accordance with the Committee &apos;s guidelines , although it did not give a great deal of information concerning the actual situation in the Islamic Republic .
31 . The events of 1979 had caused radical changes in all walks of life in the country .
The Revolution had brought with it a new type of human relations not only through positive law but also through an attempt to apply holy law .
Those entrusted with the application of that holy law sincerely thought that it brought a solution to all problems of human society .
There could be some contradiction between the prescriptions of a modern legal system and a global legal system referring to a divine legitimacy .
That contradiction had not yet been resolved and great efforts were required to find a symbiosis between the two systems .
32 . The establishment of the new legal system in the Islamic Republic had required institutions and machinery for its implementation and the brief period during which the authorities had been applying that system and the lack of sufficiently qualified persons had led to excessive errors in its implementation .
33 . The Islamic Republic of Iran had been involved in a long and difficult war which had led the authorities to take certain security measures .
The destruction of the country &apos;s economy had also prevented the direct enjoyment of another type of freedom , namely economic and social freedom .
While those restrictions might have been necessary in time of war , years had elapsed since the end of the war and he therefore found it difficult to understand why so many limitations continued to exist with regard to those rights and freedoms .
34 . One of the aims of the dialogue with the Committee should be to clarify that situation in detail .
The fact that the international community rejected systematic and continuing violations of human rights did not mean that it was hostile or biased .
The Committee was composed of independent legal experts in the human rights field who did not represent their countries but served in a personal capacity .
They represented various civilizations , some very old and others quite modern .
By acceding to the Covenant , States parties assumed certain obligations .
35 . With regard to section I of the list of issues , he noted the Iranian representative &apos;s statement that the Covenant was an integral part of national legislation .
However , more information was required in that regard , considering that the Covenant had not yet been invoked in legal proceedings and no judgement had yet been rendered on the basis of its provisions .
The Committee would also be grateful if the delegation could explain the efforts being made by the authorities to disseminate the Covenant , for example , in professional circles .
36 . Noting that article 19 of the Constitution provided that &quot; All people of Iran , whatever the ethnic group or tribe to which they belong , enjoy equal rights ; and colour , race , language and the like do not bestow any privilege &quot; , he asked whether that meant that there was no discrimination on grounds of national origin or political opinion .
He would also like to know what was the situation with regard to linguistic or national minorities and whether the right to practise one &apos;s religion or language was protected .
Lastly , he asked whether any notification had been made through the Secretary-General concerning any derogation , as required by article 4 of the Covenant .
37 . Mr. LALLAH joined in extending a warm welcome to the Iranian delegation .
The State party &apos;s resumption of the dialogue with the Committee after so many years boded well and the delegation had shown a very constructive approach in its introduction to the second periodic report , which was clearly based on extensive research , although it could have provided more information on how the legislation it described was given practical effect .
He was pleased to note the efforts being undertaken to make the provisions of the Covenant known to senior officials of ministries and administrations , something he had seen for himself during a recent visit to Tehran to attend a seminar .
Furthermore , the country &apos;s commitment to respect for the right to life had been well demonstrated by its reception of some 1.5 million refugees at the time of the recent Gulf war .
Like Mr. El Shafei , however , he would like to be sure that the State party had complied with the provisions of article 4 of the Covenant in times of emergency .
38 . Turning to paragraph 5 of the report , he inquired whether adherents of religions not enumerated in that paragraph were accorded the same treatment as those of religions that were listed there .
One had the impression that religions must first be recognized for rights to be granted .
39 . Paragraphs 16-19 of the report provided details of the workings of the judicial system , as well as insight into the status of the judiciary .
In that regard , he was surprised by the statement in paragraph 19 that whenever an individual suffered moral or material loss as a result of a default or error of a judge , the defaulting judge must stand surety for the reparation of the loss incurred .
He wondered what was intended by that constitutional provision , which might expose judges to certain risks . Did the same provision apply to both civilian and Islamic judges ?
Also in that connection , he would like to know what was the role of the clergy in the judiciary and how they interacted with civilian judges .
40 . Mr. HERNDL welcomed the delegation of the State party and asked whether the Committee might know the exact position occupied by the head of the delegation , Mr. Mehrpour , who was described in the note of introduction from the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran as a representative of the judicature .
41 . The first of the concerns he wished to raise in connection with section I of the list of issues related to the status of the Covenant within the Iranian legal system .
While he had carefully noted the replies already given in that regard , he would still appreciate clarification of the statement in paragraph 6 of the report that the provisions of the Covenant were incorporated in the Constitution as well as in other laws . How had that been done and through what specific laws ?
He was particularly concerned about the confusing effects of the application in a legal system of Islamic criteria , which according to article 4 of the Constitution must be the basis of all laws and regulations .
42 . His second concern related to the non-discrimination provisions of articles 2 , 3 and 26 of the Covenant taken together .
Both the delegation and the report had affirmed that there was equality of rights between men and women .
Yet article 21 of the Constitution appeared to establish specific women &apos;s rights .
Furthermore , paragraph 42 of the report stated that women could hold &quot; various governmental and non-governmental posts &quot; , which would imply that they might not be able to hold some posts .
Statistics had been requested on that issue , but none had been provided .
An Act of 14 May 1982 stipulated that judges were to be chosen from among men . Did that Act apply to the whole of the judiciary and was it compatible with articles 3 and 26 of the Covenant ?
Also , in civil law , in matters relating to inheritance , divorce , family planning and so on , it again seemed that different treatment was accorded as between men and women .
43 . Concerning the Baha &apos;i community , aside from the issue of freedom of religion under article 18 of the Covenant , there appeared to be a problem of access to public office and the professions .
In that regard , the ILO had questioned the degree of compliance with the 1958 Convention concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation .
Baha &apos;is had reportedly been expelled from government posts as recently as 1990 .
Baha &apos;i farmers were said to have been denied membership of agricultural cooperatives .
Young people from the Baha &apos;i community had , furthermore , reportedly been refused entrance to universities .
Such information gave reason to believe that there had been serious cases of discrimination .
A prime ministerial directive on equal opportunities in employment seemed unable to improve matters , and a Ministry of Labour directive of 8 December 1981 actually required courts to withhold any judgement in favour of dismissed employees proven to be members of the Baha &apos;i faith .
44 . Lastly , while the report largely followed the Committee &apos;s guidelines , it contained little reference to actual practice and provided virtually no statistical information .
In his view , the discussion of the legal system also failed to enable the reader to grasp the essentials of the law .
He therefore hoped that the next periodic report would offer a clearer exposition .
45 . Miss CHANET joined in welcoming the delegation of the State party , which was to be commended on breaking a silence that had lasted nearly 10 years in order to resume its reporting obligations under article 40 of the Covenant .
She appreciated the form of the report , which furthermore contained sufficient information to serve as a basis for reopening the dialogue with the Committee .
46 . In connection with section I of the list of issues , like previous speakers she would welcome clarification as to how the provisions of the Covenant had been incorporated in the Constitution and other laws .
As had also been pointed out , article 3 of the Constitution , in enumerating the rights of the individual , framed those rights with restrictions deriving from the principles of Islam , but the Covenant could not be applied in such a way as to reflect considerations determined by any one religion .
She questioned the delegation &apos;s claim that since the Covenant formed an integral part of Iranian law , the possibility of conflict was a purely theoretical matter .
She expected that Committee members &apos; questions would reveal very practical problems of conflict between the provision of the Covenant and national legal provisions .
47 . With regard , more specifically , to article 3 of the Covenant , it was stated in paragraph 42 of the report that women could be ministers , members of parliament , attorneys-at-law or university professors , or hold other high offices .
However , the Commission on Human Rights had been told only recently by its Special Rapporteur that 89 per cent of rural women were illiterate , a situation due in large part to the closure of girls &apos; schools and lack of teachers outside urban areas .
It would therefore seem that only a very small segment of the female population could have access to such posts .
She would appreciate clarification both on that issue and regarding the information provided by ILO that there were legal provisions preventing women from becoming judges .
If there were in fact women judges , what was their status in the judiciary and in what branches of law did they exercise their functions ?
It was reported , furthermore , that legal rules existed whereby compensation payable to a murder victim &apos;s next of kin was half as much for a female as for a male victim .
She also had information that women were not able to travel abroad without permission from their spouses . Was that the case and , if so , how could those rules be reconciled with the provisions of articles 3 and 12 of the Covenant ?
Regarding the Islamic dress code for women , severe penalties including corporal punishment and imprisonment were said to be imposed for violations .
It had been reported that Iranian women demonstrating against such practices on 15 June 1991 had been killed by Revolutionary Guards . Could the delegation confirm or deny that report ?
48 . On the issue of discrimination , she wished to know whether it was true that the law on the appointment of judges excluded persons born out of wedlock from the judiciary .
Lastly , she would appreciate clarification of the strange rule in criminal cases that an individual would not be liable to the death penalty if convicted of murdering a mentally ill person . Did that reflect the existence of special legislation restricting the rights of the mentally ill ?
49 . Mr. ANDO joined other members of the Committee in welcoming the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran .
The State party had submitted a good report on legal aspects of implementation of the Covenant , but more information was needed on actual practice .
50 . He wondered to what extent the Administrative Justice Tribunal mentioned in paragraph 18 of the report dealt with issues of unconstitutionality and whether any person could bring an action before the Tribunal in that connection .
If the Tribunal were able to decide that a law or regulation was unconstitutional , did that law or regulation immediately lose its effect or did the legislature have to amend or rescind it ?
Also , if the Covenant was part of ordinary law , could the constitutionality of its provisions be tested in the same fashion ?
51 . Referring to paragraph 34 of the report , he would like clarification as to the extent of liability of civil servants for damage caused in the discharge of their duties .
Regarding the military courts ( para . 32 ) , he would welcome more information concerning their jurisdiction and on means of appeal from their decisions .
In addition , he would be grateful for clarification as to the distinction between a permanent marriage and a temporary marriage ( para . 45 of the report ) and on any differences in rights between men and women in respect of transmission of nationality to their children , as well as in regard to inheritance .
Also on the subject of equality between the sexes , like Miss Chanet he was concerned to know how free women were to choose their form of dress .
Lastly , did the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran have plans to accede to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women ?
The meeting rose at 1 p.m.

CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS SUBMITTED BY STATES PARTIES UNDER ARTICLE 40 OF THE COVENANT ( agenda item 4 ) ( continued )
2 . The CHAIRMAN recalled that the Committee had called for a special report from each of the States successors to the territory of the former Yugoslavia on events that might affect human rights protected under the Covenant , based on the consideration that all the peoples within the territory were still entitled to its guarantees .
The Government of Croatia had complied with that request within the established time-limit and its report on measures taken to prevent criminal acts perpetrated in violation of human rights and freedoms in the Republic of Croatia was now before the Committee , together with some other material which the Government had provided .
He welcomed the delegation , whose presence was evidence of the Government &apos;s desire to comply with its obligations under the Covenant .
3 . Mr. ŠIMAC ( Croatia ) said it was a great honour for his delegation to appear before the Committee and describe Croatia &apos;s position , attitude and efforts directed to the protection of human rights under the Covenant .
The aggression had left 20,000 people dead and 80,000 wounded .
A quarter of the Croatian territory , which since March 1992 had been known as a United Nations-protected area , was still under Serbian occupation .
Almost half of the Croatian economy had been destroyed and many churches , cemeteries , schools , hospitals and cultural and historical monuments severely damaged or completely ruined .
Croatia was now host to some 300,000 displaced persons who had had to leave their homes in order to save their lives , and to more than 450,000 refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina .
4 . The distinction between the aggressor and the victim must form a basis for any consideration of the human rights situation in Croatia .
As one of the successors of the former Yugoslavia , Croatia had , in 1992 , declared its accession to the 1949 Geneva Conventions , and in October 1992 , had notified the Secretary-General of the United Nations of its desire to be considered a party to a number of international conventions , including the International Covenants on Human Rights .
Its declaration under article 41 of the Covenant , together with its accession to the two Optional Protocols , was imminent .
His Government paid great attention to questions of human rights , including minority rights .
The International Covenants had been taken as a basis for chapter 3 of its new Constitution of December 1990 . Copies of that chapter had been circulated to members of the Committee .
Article 14 of the Constitution provided that all citizens enjoyed human rights regardless of race , colour , language , religion , political opinion or national or social origin .
Article 21 dealt with the right to life and abolition of the death penalty .
Articles 22 and 24 , dealing with liberty and security of person , stated that no one could be arrested or detained without a written court order based on law .
Article 25 stipulated that any arrested person must be treated humanely and with respect for his dignity ; article 29 ( 3 ) that evidence illegally obtained could not be admitted in court proceedings ; article 35 that all persons must be guaranteed respect for and legal protection of personal and family life , dignity , reputation and honour ; and article 39 that any incitement to war or resort to violence or national , racial or religious hatred or any form of intolerance was prohibited and punishable .
Article 236 of the Penal Code similarly dealt with incitement to national , racial or religious intolerance or hatred as a criminal act .
Article 93 of the Constitution provided for the appointment of an ombudsman responsible for protecting the constitutional and legal rights of all citizens in relation to the Government administration and parties vested with public powers .
5 . Since alleged violations of minority rights had served as a pretext for aggression against Croatia , his country was greatly concerned with minority issues .
Ethnic problems had proved to be a crucial issue in the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia .
The document entitled &quot; Treaty provisions for the Commission &quot; , adopted in October 1991 in the framework of The Hague Conference on the Former Yugoslavia , contained a chapter on human rights , including the rights of national and ethnic groups .
It had been intended that all the republics of the former Yugoslavia should enact and implement those provisions , but only Croatia had done so : in December 1991 , it had adopted a Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and the Rights of Ethnic and National Communities or Minorities , copies of which had been circulated to members of the Committee .
The Law guaranteed all human rights and fundamental freedoms to members of minorities , together with additional rights to be enjoyed by them in accordance with all the relevant United Nations and European instruments .
Article 1 of that Law stated that it was based on the principles of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights , the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe ( CSCE ) , the Charter of Paris for a New Europe and other CSCE human rights documents , the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms , the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
6 . In compliance with The Hague instrument , the Constitutional Law contained detailed provisions granting special autonomous status to national and ethnic communities in those districts of the Republic of Croatia where their members represented over 50 per cent of the population .
That special status consisted of broad self-government in legislative , administrative and judicial matters .
Article 58 of the Constitution foresaw the conclusion of an international agreement on the establishment of an international supervisory mechanism .
Other legal provisions guaranteeing national minority rights in the Republic included the law on the social care of children under school age , laws on elementary and high schools and on education and instruction in minority languages , and the law on election to the Croatian Parliament , which provided that a national minority comprising more than 8 per cent of the total population of the Republic must be proportionally represented in parliamentary , governmental and judicial bodies and that all national minorities with less than 8 per cent of the total population must together have five representatives in the Croatian Parliament .
7 . There had been no organized policy of ethnic cleansing in the Croatian territory under the control of the Croatian authorities , who had always been decisively and uncompromisingly opposed to such a policy .
As had been stated in various international reports of inquiry , it was a policy that had been , and was still being , pursued and practised against Croatians and other non-Serbian populations in the territory under occupation and not controlled by the Croatian authorities .
The fact that it had received such vast numbers of refugees and displaced persons was yet another proof of Croatia &apos;s opposition to the inhuman policy of ethnic cleansing practised by the aggressor .
Although there had been individual cases of arbitrary arrest and killing during the early stages of spontaneous self-defence against the aggressor , the Croatian authorities had applied the rule of law throughout the territory under their control and were prosecuting the perpetrators of such criminal acts .
Since the majority of perpetrators had escaped to the occupied territory , his Government had appealed to the United Nations Protective Force ( UNPROFOR ) for help in bringing them to justice .
8 . It could be seen from his Government &apos;s report that there were no detention camps in the territory controlled by the Croatian authorities .
Even during the military aggression , the treatment of prisoners of war belonging to the so-called Yugoslav People &apos;s Army or to Serbian or Montenegrin paramilitary groups had been regulated by a special decree of the President of the Republic providing for the application of the Geneva Convention of 1949 relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War .
In the territory occupied by the aggressor and under the protection of UNPROFOR , there were still detention camps in which killings , the worst methods of torture and other inhuman treatment were practised .
The camps were mentioned by name in the report .
9 . With respect to measures taken to prevent arbitrary execution , torture or other inhuman treatment of prisoners , including prisoners of war , the provisions of article 25 of the Constitution , together with the relevant provisions of the Penal Code to which he had already referred , should act as a deterrent .
10 . As to the measures taken to combat advocacy of national , racial or religious hatred , he had already referred to article 39 of the Constitution and the relevant provisions of the Penal Code .
His Government was a strong advocate of national and religious tolerance and favoured the introduction of preventive measures to forestall any intolerance .
It had established an Office for Inter-Ethnic Relations and there was also a parliamentary Committee for Human Rights , including minority rights , to monitor the application of the law in particular cases and to make proposals for any improvements that might be needed .
11 . At the outset of the aggression against Croatia , the Ministry of the Interior had assessed the degree of danger that existed in order to protect possible targets .
Police stations in each district had been instructed to take the necessary precautions to prevent possible attacks in retaliation for the killings , bombings and other crimes frequently committed by people of Serbian nationality living in the area .
12 . That policy of the Croatian Government was an expression of its awareness of the importance of human rights , its willingness to promote them and achieve the highest international standards , and its desire to become an equal member of the international community meeting all its human rights requirements .
His delegation would be grateful for the Committee &apos;s comments and advice as to how the implementation of the Covenant could be improved in the municipal law and practice of the Republic of Croatia .
13 . Mrs. HIGGINS welcomed the delegation and expressed appreciation to Mr. Šimac , Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs , for his informative and helpful opening statement .
The Committee had been glad to be assured of the succession of the Republic of Croatia to the human rights obligations and responsibilities provided for in the Covenant , including its relationship with the Committee .
It was also interesting to learn of its intention to accede to the Optional Protocols .
With respect to the request for recommendations to assist the Republic of Croatia in its compliance with the Covenant , the Committee would make such recommendations in general terms following its consideration of the normal initial report .
The current meeting was taking place in order to consider a special report on designated questions , as provided for under article 40 of the Covenant .
14 . The Committee could not accept the claim that the distinction between the aggressor and the victim must be a basis for any consideration of the human rights situation in Croatia .
All the human rights instruments laid obligations on the parties to them , and even the Geneva Conventions did not exonerate those who regarded themselves as victims of aggression from their own responsibilities under the relevant instrument .
While the Committee well understood the factual background , it would regard each of the States concerned as responsible for their obligations under the Covenant .
15 . She had been interested to read the Croatian Government &apos;s report on various types of action being taken to prevent human rights violations .
In paragraph 26 of the report prepared by the Special Rapporteur appointed by the Commission on Human Rights ( E / CN.4 / 1992 / S-1 / 9 ) , reference was made to maltreatment of ethnic Serbs which had caused the flight of many of them from the territory of Croatia , while paragraph 29 referred to the detention of large numbers of ethnic Serbs on charges of rebellion , often with no tangible evidence of real links to the unrecognized Government of &quot; Krajina &quot; , and went on to say that that practice amounted to detention of the civilian population on the basis of their ethnic origin .
She would welcome the Croatian delegation &apos;s comments on those observations .
16 . She also inquired what measures were being adopted to ensure that prisoners were not being taken in order to be exchanged for other prisoners , since any such action would be contrary to article 9 of the Covenant .
She further asked why the CSCE mission to inspect places of detention in Bosnia and Herzegovina had reported that Croatia alone had failed to supply it with lists of places of detention , although such lists had been provided to it by the Mayor of Banja Luka , who had claimed that large numbers of detainees were being held in Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Serbian authorities , and many others were alleged to have been transported to Croatia .
She would welcome the delegation &apos;s comments on those allegations , together with information on any specific measures taken to ensure the proper treatment of detainees .
17 . Mr. HERNDL welcomed the Croatian delegation and expressed appreciation for the report and oral explanations .
18 . The current discussion was restricted to the measures taken by the Government concerned to prevent and combat specific types of violations of the rights enshrined in the Covenant .
He commended the Government for having set forth in its Constitution the various rights to which the individual was entitled and for having taken account of the Covenant in drafting those provisions .
He noted with satisfaction Croatia &apos;s declaration of succession to a number of human rights instruments and its indication that it might become a party to the two Optional Protocols within the foreseeable future .
The Government &apos;s report on measures taken to prevent criminal acts perpetrated in violation of human rights and freedoms in the Republic of Croatia responded to the Committee &apos;s concern , albeit it in a rather cursory manner .
While noting the assertion that no ethnic cleansing had been practised in the territory of Croatia controlled by the Croatian authorities , he said it was nevertheless a fact that certain people of non-Croatian ethnic origin had fled or were in prison , as borne out in the paragraphs of the report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN.4 / 1992 / S-1 / 9 ) to which Mrs. Higgins had referred .
It was stated in the Government &apos;s report that the appropriate authorities took all measures within their competence designed to prevent conduct by certain individuals that might lead to forced departures or prevention of return of any section of the population . What were the specific measures taken ?
19 . With respect to incitement to racial intolerance , intolerance in general and the application of article 20 of the Covenant , he had noted the statement that the general policy of Croatia called for the introduction of preventive conditions designed to forestall any cases of national , racial , religious or other kinds of hatred . How did the Government intend to implement that general policy ?
20 . He associated himself with Mrs. Higgins &apos; comments to the effect that armed conflict and aggression waged against the Republic of Croatia would not exonerate it from its international obligations under the Covenant , including prevention of incitement to hatred and intolerance .
He was further concerned about the statement in paragraph 27 of the Special Rapporteur &apos;s report that his mission had received copies of published lists of citizens of Croatia indicating their ethnic origin ; that those lists were widely distributed and even available for sale to the public ; and that their circulation facilitated discrimination and harassment throughout the society . Would not the Government wish to prevent the circulation of such lists , which in itself would be an incitement to deal with persons of differing ethnic origin in a way that was not permitted under the Covenant ?
21 . Mr. SADI welcomed the Croatian delegation and thanked it for providing constructive information at short notice .
The news that Croatia had acceded to the Covenant was encouraging .
22 . As Mrs. Higgins had pointed out , no signatories of the Covenant , even if they were being subjected to aggression , were absolved of responsibility for implementing its provisions .
Although atrocities might well be occurring in the portion of the country that was not under Croatian control , Croatia was accountable for what happened in the areas that it held , where human rights violations were reportedly being committed against individuals and in detention camps .
23 . The report submitted by the Croatian delegation clearly stated that no policy of ethnic cleansing was practised .
He would like to know , however , what practical measures had been adopted to promote tolerance among the various peoples residing in the Republic . Were there any educational programmes , policy campaigns or efforts to disseminate information that would promote ethnic tolerance ?
24 . It would be interesting to know what steps the Republic of Croatia believed the international community could take to help put an end to the barbaric atrocities committed against Croatians outside the country &apos;s territory and to ensure that the perpetrators of such atrocities were punished .
26 . In conclusion , he said he was convinced that the Republic of Croatia was committed to the cause of human rights .
There might be isolated problems , but with time and effort they could be solved .
27 . Miss CHANET welcomed the delegation of the Republic of Croatia and thanked it for its efforts to answer the Committee &apos;s questions despite the upheaval and destruction in the country .
She had noted with satisfaction that the Government intended to incorporate the Covenant into domestic legislation , and she was certain the dialogue with the Committee would be useful in clarifying Croatia &apos;s position on the Covenant .
28 . It was stated in the report submitted by Croatia that there was no policy of ethnic cleansing there .
That was not the view taken in the report prepared by CSCE , however , which indicated that in the territory controlled by Croatia , the Serbian population was the target of human rights violations .
The CSCE report cited cases of housing belonging to Serbs being destroyed or given to refugees , of shops belonging to Serbs being attacked , of Serbs being dismissed from Government service and of &quot; wanted &quot; notices for Serbian intellectuals being published in the Croatian press .
She asked whether those measures were not in themselves a form of ethnic cleansing .
29 . The report submitted by Croatia stated that charges had been brought against 49 individuals for kidnapping and against 33 persons for arbitrary arrests .
The CSCE report and the information provided by non-governmental organizations , however , indicated that the follow-up being given to the charges was by no means energetic .
She requested information from the delegation on how the charges were being pursued and what punishment had been decided on for individuals guilty of arbitrary arrest or summary execution .
30 . Noting the statement in the report that there were no detention camps in the territory controlled by Croatia , she requested clarification as to whether that meant that there were none in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
31 . Mr. PRADO VALLEJO said it was encouraging to see that the Government of Croatia had acceded to the Covenant .
The Covenant established a number of responsibilities , primary among which was the investigation of any violations of human rights and the punishment of the guilty parties .
The report submitted by Croatia said nothing about what was being done to deal with human rights violations which had been reported on by a number of reliable sources .
The Special Rapporteur , for example , indicated in his report ( E / CN.4 / 1992 / S-1 / 9 ) , paras . 28 and 30 ) that the importance of the human rights violations suffered by ethnic Serbs could not be underestimated , and referred to prosecution of an individual accused of being a &quot; chetnic &quot; .
Information on those points would be appreciated .
32 . Annex II to the Special Rapporteur &apos;s report mentioned an openly Fascist militia and political party that was considered to be responsible for most of the abuses committed against Serbs .
He was shocked to discover that in a day and age when human rights had been enshrined in a number of international instruments , there was a resurgence of the same mentality that had been the basis for persecution during the Nazi era .
He was sure , however , that the Committee &apos;s dialogue with the Republic of Croatia would contribute to ending human rights abuses in that country .
33 . Mr. MÜLLERSON thanked the Croatian delegation for the information provided in its opening statement and in writing .
In civil wars pitting neighbour against neighbour , there were no innocent parties .
He agreed with Mrs. Higgins that , in respect of the Covenant and other international instruments , no differentiation could be made between the aggressor and the victim of aggression .
It was for that reason that the Committee was inquiring into Croatia &apos;s implementation of the Covenant .
34 . Paragraph 26 of the Special Rapporteur &apos;s report referred to practices that had resulted in the flight of a large number of Serbs from Croatia to Serbia .
He found it difficult to see what that meant if not a form of ethnic cleansing - perhaps less violent than in other situations , but nevertheless the same phenomenon .
35 . He agreed with Mr. Herndl that clarification should be provided concerning the lists indicating the ethnic origin of citizens of Croatia . Such documents might well serve as the basis for discrimination .
36 . Finally , he agreed with other members of the Committee that an explanation should be given regarding the presence and actions of Croatian forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
37 . Mr. EL SHAFEI welcomed the delegation of a State party that had newly acceded to the Covenant and thanked it for providing as much documentation as it could .
He associated himself with the hope expressed at the end of the Croatian report that the dialogue with the Committee would assist the Republic of Croatia in implementing the Covenant , even in the current difficult situation .
38 . He would be interested to know the status of the Covenant and other international treaties signed by the Republic of Croatia in relation to domestic law .
The adoption of the Constitutional Law on Human Rights and Freedoms and the Rights of Ethnic and National Communities or Minorities , referred to in section I of the report , was a welcome development .
Article 3 of that Law indicated that the Republic protected the equality of national and ethnic groups and minorities .
He would appreciate a listing of the groups characterized as minorities , information on their numerical strength and clarification as to whether it was the Government &apos;s intention to relocate members of such groups in specific places .
The Law seemed to represent a promising effort to deal with the existence of a number of ethnic and national groups in the territory of the former Yugoslavia . Would the Croatian Government be favourable to a similar law being passed in other countries of the former Yugoslavia in relation to Croatian nationals ?
39 . Noting that the Government of Croatia had established a provisional court for human rights , he inquired how it functioned and what legal instruments and guarantees it applied .
40 . Mr. AGUILAR URBINA endorsed Mrs. Higgins &apos; comments about victims and aggressors .
Reports from a number of reliable sources indicated that all parties to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia were violating human rights .
He had been shocked to see in a recent issue of the Tribune de Genève a photograph of a Croatian soldier wearing a Nazi emblem .
Such symbols constituted violations of article 20 of the Covenant , which prohibited advocacy of national , racial or religious hatred .
He wondered what measures were being taken to cope with such violations .
41 . The lists referred to by Mr. Herndl could constitute the prelude to ethnic cleansing , and he inquired what was being done to prevent them from being drawn up .
42 . Members had been told that there were no detention camps in Croatian territory .
However , the Special Rapporteur had referred to a number of places , including schools , factories and apartments , where thousands of persons were being held .
It therefore appeared that there were places where people were detained under the jurisdiction of members of the Croatian army .
43 . The Special Rapporteur had also referred to Serbs who were being held in a bank basement in Sarajevo with Croatian soldiers in charge .
44 . According to the CSCE report and other documents before the Committee , many cases involving war crimes and ethnic cleansing had been brought before the courts and it seemed that the accused were always Serbs and never Croats .
45 . Mr. WENNERGREN congratulated the Government of Croatia on having established an Office for Inter-Ethnic Relations , which he thought would be a useful instrument .
He would like to know what instructions had been given to the Office and along what lines it would approach its tasks .
46 . With regard to the term &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; , he said that according to article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , ethnic origin should play no role at all in the enjoyment of human rights .
He would welcome information on what the Office for Inter-Ethnic Relations might do to promote the eradication of ethnic criteria in the future .
47 . He noted that the Minister of the Interior had been assigned the task of preventing sabotage and military action .
There were certainly many weapons hidden in Croatia following the armed conflict and he would like to know whether measures had been taken to prevent them from being turned over to Bosnia and Herzegovina .
He would also like to know what policies Croatia was pursuing with regard to the Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina who were in a difficult situation and in need of assistance .
48 . Mr. VUKAS ( Croatia ) referred , first of all , to the following statement in his Government &apos;s report : &quot; The Croatian Government believes that this distinction between the aggressor and the victim must be a basis of any consideration of the situation in Croatia with regard to human rights . &quot;
The statement did not mean that there should be a difference between individuals according to whether they came under the aggressor Government or were citizens of Croatia .
What his Government had wanted to indicate was that all the violations of human rights had constituted aggression .
During the war in Croatia , part of the Serbian ethnic group had joined the aggressors and committed violations .
That was the reason for the sentence in question , although he now realized that it might be interpreted as being contrary to the basis for human rights protection under the Covenant .
49 . The Office for Inter-Ethnic Relations set up by his Government had branches in various districts .
Its primary function was to propose measures to monitor the application of laws and regulations .
The branches had established a council where all representatives of different ethnic groups and minorities met to present their problems .
At the same time , they received persons whose cases had not been dealt with properly by judicial and other organs in Croatia .
They were very active and had to handle hundreds of cases .
50 . From the point of view of international law , it was clear that the sovereign State of Bosnia and Herzegovina , recognized by the United Nations and a State Member of the Organization , had the right to individual and collective self-defence .
Unfortunately , the United Nations could only try to provide humanitarian assistance .
As a neighbouring State , Croatia was entitled to help its young neighbour to survive .
That was the relationship between the two States , but the Government of Croatia could not be held responsible for atrocities committed in the other State .
51 . With regard to the status of international treaties , in early October his Government had notified the depositaries of many international treaties of its decision to consider itself a successor State in respect of the ratification of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
Concerning bilateral treaties , his Government intended to be bound by all the obligations of the former Yugoslavia if the treaties were in accordance with Croatia &apos;s interests .
Under article 134 of the Constitution , international agreements concluded and ratified in accordance with the Constitution were part of Croatia &apos;s international order and prevailed over national legislation .
52 . Referring to the question of ethnic groups and minorities in Croatia , he said that in addition to Croats there were Serbs , Muslims , Slovenes , Czechs , Italians , Hungarians , Jews and other groups .
Anyone who wished to be considered as belonging to a minority had the right to do so and enjoyed all the rights guaranteed under the Constitution .
There was no wish on the part of the Government to change anything in respect of their geographical situation .
53 . The Government of Croatia had included provisions in its Constitutional Law of December 1991 with regard to minorities , but those provisions and the implementation of substantive regulations depended on the willingness of those concerned to accept them .
The application of those rules , particularly those concerning the Serbian minority , depended on a decision of the present rulers of that minority in one part of Croatia to recognize that they were citizens of Croatia and that their future should be within the framework of the Croatian legal order and the international solutions found to the problems of the former Yugoslavia .
In that connection , he said that Serbs living in other parts of Croatia had recently received new schools and a Serbian organization called the Serbian Community , which had been banned in the early 1950s , had been re-established to protect the national rights of Serbs in Croatia .
54 . His Government used the term &quot; ethnic &quot; in the spirit of the provisions of article 27 of the Covenant .
It was merely being realistic to acknowledge the existence of ethnic minorities in Croatia .
55 . Mr. KRAPAC ( Croatia ) said that the Croatian system of criminal justice operated according to the well-known continental pattern whereby the police carried out inquiries and were obliged to report all cases to the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office .
Following an investigation , a charge-sheet was drawn up and the case was tried in a court , which then handed down a judgement .
There were courts of first instance , courts of second instance and a Supreme Court which was the guardian of the law .
At the beginning of the war against Croatia , that system had operated for several months under extremely difficult conditions and the police authorities had been the only forces able to offer resistance to the military action .
As a result , certain police forces had been unable to perform their functions .
The situation had then improved and , after 1 January 1992 , the police had been able to perform their duties in a more normal fashion .
56 . According to the Ministry of Justice , judicial statistics for the period August 1990-July 1992 showed that the number of persons reported for criminal offences connected with the war or armed conflict in Croatia was 21,951 .
Those reported for a specific offence against State security included Serbs , Croats and Muslims .
57 . Other criminal offences classified as crimes against humanity and international law involved 1,880 persons .
They were perpetrators of war crimes against civilian populations and prisoners of war .
58 . Members of the military who committed crimes were brought before military courts .
In that connection , he said that the total number of such persons , who belonged to all nationalities , was 6,829 .
59 . With regard to the question raised concerning the word &quot; clarified &quot; , he said that it was a police term which meant that where a perpetrator had been identified and reported to the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office , the latter took action under the so-called principle of mandatory prosecution - a concept from German and Austrian law - and requested the opening of a judicial investigation .
60 . According to the data available , there had so far been 423 court judgements , 91 per cent resulting in convictions , for criminal offences in connection with the armed conflict .
Account should be taken of the fact that , while justice must be served , it must not be hasty .
61 . With regard to allegations in the CSCE report concerning the destruction of over 6,000 Serbian homes in the previous 10 months , the following figures had been provided by the Croatian Ministry of the Interior : from 1 January to 31 August 1992 , there had been 4,014 cases of destruction of homes in which the victims had been Serbs , 1,067 cases involving Croats and 115 cases involving members of other groups .
62 . With regard to the concrete measures taken in the criminal justice system to combat advocacy of racial and religious hatred , he referred to article 39 of the Constitution and to data provided by the Ministry of the Interior to the effect that 42 crimes of incitement to national or religious intolerance or hatred under article 236 ( k ) of the Penal Code had been reported in the first 9 months of 1992 .
Of those , 40 had been &quot; clarified &quot; .
63 . Regarding Mr. El Shafei &apos;s point concerning the establishment of a court for human rights in Croatia , Croatia had a Constitutional Court , which , in addition to its competence to review the Constitution and legislation , now had the power to receive human rights complaints from individuals .
64 . Mr. ŠIMAC ( Croatia ) said his Government fully shared the view expressed by several members that a Government must not be exonerated from responsibility for human rights violations occurring in its territory .
However , a distinction should be made between the three quarters of the territory controlled by the Croatian Government , for which the Government was responsible , and the portion that was occupied by the Serbs and under the protection of UNPROFOR , where it was not possible , practically speaking , to control human rights violations .
Such violations were the result of the abnormal psychological state of the inhabitants and in reaction to earlier atrocities .
Without giving the impression that the Croatian Government was attempting to justify those violations , he wished to stress the difference between them and the initial violations in Croatia , aimed not only at the State but also at Croatian citizens , mostly Croats and other non-Serbs , and in a few cases at Serbs who had refused to join the Serbian army .
65 . On the subject of detention camps in Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Croatian Government could not be held responsible for violations in other independent sovereign States .
He was therefore not competent to reply to the questions concerning detention camps in that country .
Regarding detention camps in Croatia , none existed in the meaning he attached to that term , i.e. concentration camps similar to those that had existed during the Second World War .
Due to the war , Croatia did have three prisoner-of-war camps in its territory , which were under the control of the Ministry of Defence .
Rules for the treatment of the prisoners had been laid down in a decree of the President of the Republic , and the provisions of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 were applied .
66 . Nevertheless , it should be mentioned that , in the framework of spontaneous self-defence actions against Serbian and Montenegrin aggression in Croatia , at a time when Croatia had been weaponless and without a military force , there had been some cases where the inhabitants of Serbian villages had been taken hostage .
The members of the Serbian population in Croatia who had collaborated with the Yugoslav army were considered by the Croatians to be criminals and had been convicted by Croatian courts .
He stressed that those events had occurred at a stage of the war when Croatia had been unable to defend itself with its regular forces and had been out of control of over half its territory .
67 . Regarding the incidents of attacks on Serbian-owned shops reported by CSCE , he said that one such incident had been sparked off by the murder of a local policeman , ambushed by Serbian terrorists .
The Croatian police had moved to arrest the culprit and restore order .
That explanation was not meant to justify such behaviour , which was against the policy of the Croatian Government .
Concerning reports of people losing jobs because of their ethnic origin , he said that the Croatian Government was conducting investigations into an incident in which members of the Croatian Democratic Union , the leading Croatian political party , had allegedly written threatening letters to Serbian intellectuals .
The party leaders rejected those allegations as unfounded , and it did appear that they had not been proved .
68 . The list of acts of violence against Serbs reflected acts by individuals and not an official policy on the part of the Croatian Government , which was that all must live together in mutual respect .
There was no perfect society , and it could not be assumed that a country emerging from communist rule , having won its independence through an extremely violent armed conflict , would rapidly attain the highest degree of respect for human rights .
Violations did exist in Croatia , but the Government was doing everything possible to see that the law was applied to punish those responsible .
69 . Regarding the extremist right-wing party in Croatia , he noted that extremists existed in every country .
At the recent elections in early August , that party had won only one third as much support as the National Front in France ; those results clearly showed its insignificance .
Furthermore , that party and its military wing had been condemned by the Croatian Government , and the party leaders , three Members of Parliament , had had their immunity removed and were being investigated .
70 . Regarding the concrete measures mentioned by several members , he referred again to the country &apos;s constitutional and legal provisions .
The Government was aware , however , that those provisions must be implemented , and the political campaign for the recent August elections had placed strong emphasis on respect for human rights and especially the rights of minorities , an issue of which public opinion was keenly aware .
There were also the activities of the Ministry of the Interior aimed at preventing the violence , especially of an ethnic nature , that continued to occur throughout the territory .
The police , for its part , was attempting to protect public and private buildings , in particular Serbian-owned homes , against possible attacks .
71 . Unfortunately , the Croatian Government could do nothing about violations in the part of the territory out of its control , where , as eyewitnesses who had fled or been expelled testified , incidents of ethnic cleansing , expulsions , arbitrary arrests , executions , torture and racial and religious hatred continued to occur .
He hoped the presence of UNPROFOR would help to increase respect for human rights in those areas and enable the Croatian Government to regain control of the entire territory , restore the conditions for peaceful coexistence and enable the expelled to return to their country .
72 . As to how the Human Rights Committee and the international community could help the Government of Croatia ensure respect for human rights in the country , he said that his delegation &apos;s presence before the Committee was an extremely important contribution in that respect and expressed gratitude for the opportunity to explain his country &apos;s position .
Human rights experts in the Committee and other United Nations human rights bodies could also be of help .
Croatia hoped in May 1993 to host a CSCE seminar on human rights in Croatia and other CSCE member countries .
It was also attempting to secure cooperation in that field from international bodies at the European level , such as the Council of Europe .
73 . Mrs. HIGGINS thanked the Croatian delegation for its informative answers and requested a few clarifications on facts .
Firstly , she asked whether the figure of 423 court judgements with 91 per cent convictions represented figures for all criminal offences or only those brought before the military tribunals , which were of the most interest to the Committee .
Secondly , the Committee had been assured that the three prisoner-of-war camps in Croatia applied the provisions of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 . Did that mean that the International Committee of the Red Cross had access to them and that full lists of prisoners were provided ?
Thirdly , she would like to know whether it was being suggested that in the area controlled by UNPROFOR , violations had been committed by all national parties or only certain ones .
74 . Mr. AGUILAR URBINA associated himself with the first two clarifications requested by Mrs. Higgins .
75 . Mr. MÜLLERSON noted that , in the copies of the Croatian Constitution distributed to the members , page 1 , and therefore also article 1 of the Croatian Constitution which the representatives had cited , were missing .
He asked whether the members could be provided with a copy of the missing material .
The meeting rose at 1 p.m.

The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
ORGANIZATION OF WORK ( agenda item 2 ) ( continued )
1 . The CHAIRMAN said that on the previous day the sessional working group had had a very successful meeting to prepare the lists of questions , which would be finally adopted by the pre-sessional working group in January 1993 .
If members had any further suggestions , they could be added .
The draft optional protocol , which the Committee had been hoping to discuss at the present meeting , would not be available in the working languages until the next meeting .
PREPARATORY ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE WORLD CONFERENCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS ( agenda item 7 )
2 . The CHAIRMAN said that the Committee ought to make a submission to the World Conference , or at least to the Preparatory Committee .
He was prepared to draft a short paper , but before doing so he would like to hear the comments of members .
3 . Mrs. JIMÉNEZ BUTRAGUEÑO read out some recommendations presented to the Preparatory Committee for the World Conference by the International Federation on Ageing and the American Association of Retired Persons , contained in document A / CONF.157 / PC / 46 / Add.7.
She suggested that in its submission the Committee should draw attention to the importance of the human rights of the elderly .
4 . Mr. SIMMA said that the Committee should make a distinctive input to the World Conference , more precise and specific than its first paper .
The input should be related to the Committee &apos;s method of work and to the way in which the Covenant was being implemented and the problems that were being encountered .
The Committee &apos;s best contribution would perhaps be an optional protocol to the Covenant , on which work should be continued .
5 . Mr. NENEMAN fully agreed with Mr. Simma &apos;s remarks .
The Committee could also highlight problems like the universal acceptance of the Covenant , to which the United States of America , in particular , was unfortunately not yet a party .
It might also be a good idea to consider the possibility of uniting the two International Covenants on Human Rights , since the political conditions which had originally led to their subject-matter being divided into two separate instruments had disappeared .
An optional protocol to the International Convention on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights would be more readily acceptable now than it would have been before , since regional organizations had paved the way in some respects .
6 . The CHAIRMAN observed that the meeting of persons chairing human rights treaty bodies had called on States to ratify both Covenants ; six States had ratified one but not the other .
7 . Mr. MRATCHKOV agreed with the comments made by Mr. Simma and Mr. Neneman .
He suggested that the Committee might mention the problem of periodic reporting , without indicating the countries that had not submitted their reports on time .
In view of the present unfavourable economic situation in both developing and developed countries and the resulting vulnerability of economic , social and cultural rights , the Committee might insist that States parties be requested to supply more information on how the Covenant was being implemented in actual practice .
The indivisibility of all human rights should also be stressed. page
8 . Mr. RATTRAY said that his basic concern was to give concrete meaning to the concept that the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights were interdependent and indivisible .
The Committee had tried to lay down some basic criteria and standards by which violations would be judged but it had not yet found any general basis for ensuring that the rights proclaimed in the International Convention on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights were legally enforceable and justiciable .
A strategy should therefore be devised for moving towards the acceptance of the full enforceability and justiciability of economic , social and cultural rights .
That was a fundamental challenge which the World Conference would have to face , since civil and political rights could hardly be enjoyed on an empty stomach , especially in developing countries .
The Committee was uniquely placed to deal with the issue of interdependence and indivisibility , and it should therefore establish basic standards for the domestic enforceability of the rights set forth in the Covenant .
9 . Mr. SIMMA noted that the meeting of persons chairing human rights treaty bodies had recommended that a sessional working group of chairpersons should be convened during sessions of the Preparatory Committee and at the World Conference itself .
He welcomed Mr. Neneman &apos;s idea that the time might be ripe for merging the two International Covenants on Human Rights .
Of the six States that had ratified one of the Covenants but not the other , only one , the United States of America , had ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights but not the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .
He agreed with Mr. Rattray that the Committee had a natural role to play in developing the interdependence and indivisibility of the two Covenants , although some difficulties might be encountered , since a number of States did quite well in implementing economic , social and cultural rights without recognizing that they had the same status as civil and political rights .
10 . The CHAIRMAN said that he would take account of the comments and suggestions made and would produce a draft text for further reflection .
The meeting rose at 10.50 a.m.

CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS ( agenda item 5 ) ( continued )
( a ) REPORTS SUBMITTED BY STATES PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLES 16 AND 17 OF THE COVENANT ( continued )
Italy ( E / 1990 / 6 / Add.2 )
1 . At the invitation of the Chairman , Mr. Mezzalama , Mr. Verga , Mr. Citarella , Mr. Amatucci , Mrs. Passananti , Mrs. Palumbo and Mrs. Carla ( Italy ) took places at the Committee table .
2 . Mr. MEZZALAMA ( Italy ) pointed out that the second periodic report of Italy ( E / 1990 / 6 / Add.2 ) had been drafted nearly three years earlier and that there had been greater dynamism in the economic and social sector than in that of civil and political rights .
There had not been enough time to undertake an almost total redraft of the report and he therefore congratulated the Committee on having identified a number of extremely pertinent issues in document E / C.12 / WG / 1992 / CRP.3 / Rev.1 ; in replying to them he would in fact be updating the text of the report .
3 . The report had reflected the positive economic and social situation prevailing in Italy in 1989 .
Today , the country was beset by very grave economic problems because of the international economic situation and its internal budget deficit , which had imposed extraordinary financial burdens and taxation .
It also faced problems caused by the privatization of national industry .
In Italy the public sector accounted for more than 50 per cent of industrial production ; at present a partial privatization of public enterprises was taking place which posed problems of preserving jobs during the change-over in management .
The situation and outlook were thus very difficult from those on which the report had been based over two and a half years earlier .
4 . Replying to the Committee &apos;s request concerning a country profile , he said that the geographical position of Italy and its long coastline invited immigration .
The focal points of current international crises were partly in the Mediterranean region , and Italy had been subject to exceptional pressure from neighbouring Eastern European countries , beginning with Albania and the former Yugoslovia .
Its position exposed it to an enormous wave of people seeking humanitarian aid .
5 . The population of Italy was approximately 59 million .
Until recently there had been an annual population growth of 1 to 2 per cent , but the previous year for the first time an entirely new phenomenon had appeared : the growth rate had been zero .
That trend would have to be monitored to see if it was temporary or long-term .
Inter-provincial or interregional movements had influenced the population : the movement from the south to the more industrialized north had gradually diminished , while the concentration of the population in large cities had increased .
Immigration from countries outside the European Community , especially from the Maghreb , had been felt in rural regions and those dependent on fishing activities .
6 . Despite the fact that a large part of Italy was mountainous , 69.5 per cent of the national territory was devoted to agriculture .
However , industrial expansion had been greater than that of agriculture : 35 per cent of the population was employed in the industrial sector , mostly in processing industries , in particular engineering and metallurgy .
At present there was a tendency to establish industry in the traditionally agricultural south .
Since Italy had to import important raw materials such as oil , its foreign trade showed an excess of imports over exports , both with Community countries , in particular Germany , the United Kingdom and France , and non-Community countries among which the United States occupied the leading place .
Imports were increasing at a faster rate than exports .
7 . With regard to its political structure , Italy was by its Constitution a democratic Republic based on work in all its forms .
Sovereignty was vested in the people , who exercised it principally through elections and referendums .
High priority was attached to the activity of Parliament ; the other supreme bodies of the Republic were the President , the Government , the magistracy , the regions and the Constitutional Court .
The Parliament was based on the bicameral system : a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate , both elective and representative .
The legislative function was exercised jointly by the two houses .
The President of the Republic represented national unity and was elected by the Parliament for a term of seven years , which was renewable .
The Government was formed by the President and the Council of Ministers .
The President appointed the Prime Minister , who in his turn appointed the Ministers ; together they formed the Council of Ministers .
In the Constitution , the rules governing the organization of the judiciary were very important : in particular , the Constitutional character of the magistracy made judges autonomous and independent of any other authority .
The Italian Republic , one and indivisible , nevertheless provided for extensive local autonomy for the regions , which had administrative as well as legislative power .
The Constitution recognized equality without regard to race , colour , religion , etc. and guaranteed the respect of the fundamental rights of the human person .
8 . Describing the way in which Italy fulfilled its obligations under International Covenants on Human Rights , he explained that the Interministerial Committee of Human Rights , which composed of representatives of all the ministries concerned , met regularly to draft reports deriving from international obligations under the various instruments which Italy had ratified .
9 . With regard to the availability of the report , he said that it had not been widely circulated in advance because it had been thought desirable to await the comments and criticisms of the Committee .
However , the report had been printed in specialized journals , including in a review published by the University of Padua .
The report had therefore had some publicity among specialized circles in Italy .
10 . In reply to the question on the status of the Covenant in Italian domestic law , he said that special importance was given to the Covenants and the European Convention on Human Rights .
Since the ratification of the Covenant , its standards , had been frequently applied .
Italian law was brought into line with international standards by a special procedure .
On one hand , it was assured automatically and continuously by article 10 of the Constitution , which stipulated that the Italian legal order should be in keeping with generally recognized standards of international law .
On the other hand , the Italian legal system did not contain general provisions for adapting domestic law to the obligations laid down by international standards .
In most cases recourse was made to an enforcement order , which was incorporated in the same law that contained the authorization to ratify the treaty .
If formal adaptation implied a change to domestic standards , the enforcement order was made in the form of a law ; thus , any discrepancy between the international convention and national legislation was corrected by the very law which ratified the international instrument .
Of course , any abrogation , change or innovation in respect of domestic law took effect only when the international convention entered into force at the international level .
The standards of the convention then had the same binding force as those established directly by national legislators .
Only when the international standards were not self-executing was it necessary to promulgate special legislation. page
11 . As regards specific non-discrimination provisions in national law , thus far it had not been necessary to introduce them because all Italian legislation , starting with the Constitution , proclaimed the principle of parity : the general principles of non-discrimination formed part of the spirit and substance of the Italian legal system .
12 . Regarding the limitations imposed on the exercise of rights set forth in articles 6 to 15 of the Covenant , he said that those articles were covered by article 39 of the Italian Constitution , which affirmed the freedom of trade union organizations , a principle reaffirmed by the Labour Act of 1970 which not only annulled acts and agreements tending to discriminate against trade union members but also allowed union activities to be carried out in the workplace itself .
Article 40 of the Italian Constitution recognized the right to strike ; to guarantee its effectiveness , other rules such as article 4 of Act No. 604 of 1976 and article 15 of the Labour Act prohibited employers from limiting the exercise of rights and giving rise to any discrimination based on the participation of employees in union activities .
In Italian legislation , however , there were limitations on the right to strike protecting the basic rights of citizens .
Act No. 146 of 1990 relating to essential public services made strikes subject to a 10-day period of notice and the adoption of measures guaranteeing the continuity of the public services .
The law also provided for the possibility of prohibiting strikes where there was effective danger of a serious and imminent prejudice to the rights of the person guaranteed by the Constitution .
The same logic governed the conditions and limits of the right to strike in the nuclear energy sector and air transport .
Military personnel and the police were not allowed to strike ; however , by virtue of Act No. 121 of 1971 they could , except for career military personnel , form or belong to or be representatives in a certain category of trade union .
13 . Turning to the questions concerning the migrant population , he recalled that because of its geographical position and liberal traditions , Italy had always welcomed a great number of foreign workers .
Recently , however , the Italian labour market had been substantially influenced both by the intensification of the immigration process and by the domestic mobility of immigrants caused by the notable regional diversification in rates of employment .
On 31 December 1991 the Ministry of the Interior had recorded the presence of 900,000 foreign workers , a 15 per cent increase over that of 31 December of the previous year .
The heaviest influx was in northern Italy , 28.7 per cent .
In southern Italy and the islands the numbers were lower : 21.5 per cent and 5.1 per cent respectively .
International political crises had also played a part as shown by the recent increase in Slovenian , Croatian and Albanian immigrants , particularly in the Adriatic regions .
In 1991 migrant workers in Italy came from all continents of the world in varying percentages : 34.4 per cent from Europe , 30.7 per cent from Africa , 18 per cent from Asia , 16.4 per cent from America and 0.5 per cent from Oceania .
Among the 169 countries involved , Tunisia , Philippines , Germany , the former Yugoslavia , Senegal , Albania , Egypt and China were particularly prominent .
To address the problem the Italian Government in recent years had adopted two important measures : Act No. 943 of 1986 and Act No. 39 of 1990 .
The first measure defined the machinery for the employment of workers from outside the European Community and introduced transitional measures for regulating their legal status in Italy .
Given that clandestine immigration continued and that it was necessary to regulate the position of migrant workers arriving in Italy under the terms laid down by the Act of 1986 , the second law was promulgated aimed at regulating the influx and length of stay of migrants from outside the Community and to regularize illegal situations .
The new law represented the first stage of a more general policy to be applied through interministerial decrees published at the latest by the end of October each year .
In 1992 , entry had been limited to the following categories : those who sought refugee status ; family members of non-Community persons residing legally in Italy and employed there ; non-Community citizens authorized to stay for reasons of employment , on condition that it was not possible to employ another non-Community citizen already resident in Italy .
To assist prospective immigrants an information handbook had been published in English , Arabic , French and Spanish and widely disseminated , particularly in North Africa .
14 . Replying to questions under article 6 of the Covenant , he said that since the report had been drafted the halt or regression in respect of economic growth had affected living standards .
The unfavourable economic situation had already been heralded in Italy in 1990 , by the reduction of gross domestic product and the growth in public indebtedness .
At present public debt was at about the same level as gross domestic product , leaving a very narrow margin for manoeuvre .
That context , as well as the consequences of the process of European unification , had compelled the Government to develop policies to control inflation ; it has been called to order by the European Community and told to change its policy .
The programmes it had already set in motion aimed at resolving the dilemma of ensuring recovery without compromising the functioning of the social State .
The grave situation of economic inequality had led the authorities to try to rationalize public expenditures and direct resources towards critical situations .
In particular , the Parliament , in the Act of 23 October 1992 , had asked the Government to promulgate standards for rationalization of public health , public sector employment and local finances .
The activities aimed at promoting a recovery already under way focused mainly on issues of employment in certain regions and in certain sections of the active population , particularly women .
Measures had been taken focusing on retraining , an appropriate use of social shock absorbers and a more flexible labour market policy with safeguards for workers .
The initial results could be seen in the control of inflation , which had stabilized at 4.5 per cent .
Trade unions had understood the situation and made a praiseworthy effort to narrow areas of confrontation .
In order to cement an organic incomes policy , a tripartite agreement had been reached the previous July between trade unions , employers and Government to bring inflation down to 2 per cent by 1994 through freezing the system of wage indexation .
The three parties had also made a commitment to boost employment and to bring the rules governing the public and private sectors into line .
15 . It was difficult to establish statistics concerning the proportion of the population holding more than one job , since second jobs were rarely declared to the authorities .
It was , however , a common practice in Italy to hold a second job , especially in the public sector where the working day in most cases ended in the early afternoon , allowing time for further employment elsewhere .
However , employment in the public service was another area of impending radical change in Italy .
It had been decided to apply the conditions prevailing in the private sector to the public service , which hitherto had enjoyed shorter working hours and greater job security , thus reducing the opportunity for moonlighting .
16 . In Italy , unemployment was generally defined as a situation in which a person was either without a job or seeking one .
However , in some cases large numbers of persons remained unemployed when jobs were available because they did not have the skills required to fill those posts , a situation termed technological unemployment .
Such unemployment was increasing as techniques advanced and changes were introduced in the way industry was organized , with automation for example replacing manual labour .
In the eyes of the law , a part-time worker was one working for periods less than the hours provided for the working week , month or year by the collective agreements in the sector concerned .
Persons working less than 22 hours a week ( horizontal part-time ) were considered as unemployed .
Persons working in individual blocks of several weeks , months or years ( vertical part-time work ) were not considered as unemployed outside those periods .
A number of types of unemployment were recognized in addition to the traditionally accepted definition of the term .
17 . In answer to the question on the rights of migrant workers , current Italian law provided for equal treatment of Italian and foreign workers .
Article 8 of Act No. 943 of 1986 stipulated that remuneration could not be less than that established by the collective agreements in the sector concerned .
European Community workers legally resident in Italy and on the unemployment register as seeking work were entitled to all social welfare benefits available to Italian workers .
Act No. 39 of 1990 , which made provision for regularizing the status of non-Community workers and stateless persons illegally resident in Italy , enshrined the same principle .
At 30 September 1992 , there had been 750,000 non-European Community workers in Italy : 340,000 in the north , 260,000 in the centre and 139,000 in the south .
There were no exact figures for the number of illegal immigrants in the country since they were difficult to count but in the two years since the regularization legislation had been in place , 220,000 of the estimated 400,000 non-Community illegal migrants in Italy had now regularized their position .
The rest , principally street vendors or seasonal agricultural workers , had an obvious interest in remaining clandestine .
The most recent figures showed that 34,000 of the non-Community nationals who had come into Italy between January and September 1992 had regularized their positions .
That number was expected to reach 45,000 by the end of 1992 .
Of the recent legal immigrants , 6,000 were asylum seekers from Eastern Europe , including displaced persons who wished eventually to return home .
A further 5,000 had entered under Italian legislation entitling non-Community nationals to join a family member legally resident in Italy .
Of the newcomers , 15,000 were household workers ; the household sector thus absorbed a large proportion of non-Community migrants which came , in descending order of numbers , from Morocco , Tunisia , the Philippines , the former Yugoslavia , Senegal , Albania , China , Poland , Brazil , Sri Lanka and Romania .
There was a reasonably sustained demand for seasonal workers in agriculture , where irregular practices were common , and draft legislation to regularize the position of such workers , was expected to be adopted shortly .
As a step towards regularizing the position of non-Community nationals working as street vendors , who had generally entered the country illegally , they had recently been permitted to become employers of a maximum of two helpers .
18 . The right to a minimum wage was guaranteed by article 26 of the Constitution .
Salary scales were determined by collective bargaining which embraced all sectors of the labour market including home work paid by the piece .
In any area where remuneration was not covered by collective agreements , salary scales were set by special regional commissions .
The scala mobile system , which had been a feature of Italian life for decades , would be coming to an end on 31 December 1992 under a Protocol agreed between the Government and the trade unions on 31 July 1992 , whereby wage indexation would be replaced by a lump sum payment of 20,000 lire a month from January 1993 .
A question had been asked on the nature and frequency of occupational accidents and occupational disease .
Industrial accidents , leading to death or permanent or partial disability , principally occurred in the mining , metallurgical and building industries .
There had been 4,000 such accidents , two per working day , during the past 10 years .
The incidence of occupational diseases , had decreased in the industrial sector from 58,212 in 1988 to 46,000 in 1991 .
19 . Turning to the questions relating to article 9 ( right to social security ) the Italian legislation in force provided that claimants to a surviving spouse &apos;s pension would , in the case of divorce , be entitled to such benefit provided they had not subsequently married or were already receiving a pension .
Eligibility for such benefit should , furthermore , have existed before the divorce .
In cases where there were several claimants for a surviving spouse &apos;s pension the courts would decide the issue , taking all financial and other conditions into account .
Italians and foreigners legally resident in the country had equal access to social security benefits under article 11 of Decree No. 195 of 1992 .
Employers &apos; made equal contributions in both cases ; however , foreigners in addition had to contribute to a special fund covering possible repatriation for indigent workers .
Only the social pension was restricted to Italian citizens .
The social pension however , was not a form of social welfare insurance , but was intended to assist citizens on insufficient incomes .
It was financed solely by the State from a fund which received no contributions from employers or employees .
European Community directive No. 92 on social security for workers moving within the Community recognized that fact .
The social pension was also recognized under article 7 of the Treaty of Rome as a benefit restricted to Italian and European Community nationals .
20 . In reply to the questions asked under article 10 of the Covenant ( protection of the family , mothers and children ) , article 29 of the Italian Constitution recognized the family founded on marriage as the natural unit of society .
Both spouses within a marriage were morally and legally equal within the limits established by the law to safeguard the family unit .
Italian legislation regarded as legitimate only those families founded on marriage , but families not founded on marriage , de facto families , were increasingly being recognized in Italian case law .
A recent reform of family law had introduced the concept of the family enterprise , which provided for distribution of the benefits of such enterprises in proportion to the quality and quantity of work contributed .
21 . With regard to the illegal employment of minors , the labour inspectorate had recently carried out surveys to determine its extent but had found that the legislation for the protection of minors was complied with in most cases since infringements carried heavy penalties .
In the south of Italy , there were 60,000 employees between 15 and 18 years of age and 4,000 under the age of 15 .
The latter figure included illegally employed children and legally employed minors between the age of 14 and 15 .
In 1989 , the number of apprenticeship applications approved by the labour inspectorates had been 122,151 : 78,000 in northern Italy , 23,000 in the centre and 20,000 in the south .
Minors were employed principally in light industry such as clothing and footwear , in engineering workshops and building sites and in small trades and small retail enterprises .
Under the law of 1967 on the employment of adolescents and children , 15 years was the minimum age for starting work except for agricultural workers , family workers and employees engaged in light work outside industry where the minimum starting age was 14 .
In the case of arduous work or work hazardous to health the minimum starting age was 16 .
22 . The cost of maternity leave for workers in the public sector was paid by the State and for those in the private sector by the National Institute for Social Insurance .
Under the relevant legislation , the payments for statutory maternity leave would be made by the health insurer .
The maternity leave entitlement was two months before the expected date of the birth and three months subsequently .
In addition a mother was entitled to stay away from work for a period of six months during the first year of life of the child and to absent herself form work during any medically certified illness of the child up to the age of three years .
Such absences could carry a reduction in salary but had no impact on calculation of length of service or pension entitlements .
The law prohibited dismissal of a mother from the time pregnancy was confirmed to the child &apos;s first birthday .
Day care facilities were provided by local authorities for children up to three years of age in order to facilitate the access of women to work .
Applications for setting up such facilities were authorized by the regional authorities on the basis of a plan submitted annually to the Ministry of Health which financed them from a special fund .
The law prohibiting dismissal of women for maternity reasons did not cover household workers .
Such workers were protected only during the period from submission of a medical certificate of pregnancy to the start of maternity leave .
In practice , however , because of the demand for household workers was greater than the supply , such workers had no difficulty in finding another job after the birth of a child .
However , reform of the law was envisaged to put an end to the anomaly .
23 . In Italy , the introduction of divorce had been a very complex and difficult issue .
The concordat between Italy and the Holy See gave religious marriage a status in Italian civil law , and since canon law , did not recognize divorce the term could not be mentioned in legislation .
The Act of 1970 therefore did not contain the term &quot; divorce &quot; , since it was inapplicable in civil or religious marriage , but provided for the dissolution of a marriage if performed outside the Roman Catholic Church ; if performed within the Church , for the cessation of the civil effects of the marriage .
Recent case law upheld the constitutional legality of the procedure to bring the civil effects of a marriage to an end .
With regard to the religious effects of a marriage , the ecclesiastic jurisdiction continued to be competent under the concordat .
The Act recognized a number of sufficient causes for dissolution of marriage , including three years of effective separation .
Divorce proceedings before the courts included a conciliation procedure .
Reform of the current law was directed towards reducing the period of separation necessary before dissolution of marriage , acceleration of the procedure and improvement of financial provisions , which would permit allowances to be made to partners taking into account the standard of living prevailing during the marriage .
24 . Turning to article 11 , he said that 62 per cent of the flats in Italy were owned by the persons living in them .
A total of 700,000 requests had been made for rent-controlled housing .
As part of the Government &apos;s privatization programme , 200,000 State-owned flats had been offered for sale to their tenants .
25 . With regard to article 12 , owing to the current economic situation , it had been necessary to make a number of changes in Italy &apos;s very generous public health system , especially as costs in that sector were the principal cause of the deficit in the national budget .
A number of drastic cuts had recently been announced by the Minister for Health : persons in higher income brackets must bear part of the costs of their health care ; certain categories of medicine were no longer free ; and the number of patients had been reduced for whom doctors working for the national health care system could automatically have their fees reimbursed by the State .
26 . He noted that with 15,000 persons having contracted AIDS and 80,000 having tested HIV-positive , Italy was suffering greatly from the AIDS epidemic .
The Italian Government had elaborated a plan to address the problem , and the Italian Parliament had adopted a framework legislation to that end .
A programme had begun to assist AIDS patients and to enable them to receive professional therapy at home , but it was also important to ensure that such persons were not cut off from their contacts in the community .
A question of mentality was at issue , and it was therefore essential to make the public aware that AIDS patients must not be isolated , because such attitudes raised obstacles to the Government &apos;s efforts .
27 . The legislation concerning drug users and drug traffickers had been modified .
In the past , vague parameters had been set for the courts on what had been assumed to be an individual &apos;s average daily drug consumption , and that had opened the way to illegal trafficking : a person could claim that the drugs found on his person were for personal consumption , whereas in reality he only consumed half and sold the rest .
Those parameters had been changed in 1990 .
28 . Drug users were no longer sent to prison .
If a drug user accepted treatment , criminal proceedings were not instituted .
If , however , he refused treatment or was caught again in the possession of drugs , then other legal steps were envisaged , but imprisonment was considered only as a last resort .
The Government &apos;s goal was to rehabilitate drug users .
On the other hand , sanctions for drug dealing had been stiffened .
29 . Italy was interested in international efforts to combat drug trafficking and in strengthening international mechanisms to that end .
30 . Mr. AMATUCCI ( Italy ) , replying to questions on article 13 , said that the term &quot; cultural homogenization &quot; used in paragraphs 143 and 146 of the second periodic report of Italy meant that all pupils were entitled to the same education without discrimination .
On the contrary , the school programmes stressed the importance of the concept of inter-cultural education and the mutual enrichment that resulted from the presence of foreign pupils in the schools .
The aim of the Italian Government was to achieve the social integration of foreigners , not to force them to renounce their culture .
The presence of foreign children in schools was used to activate a dialogue .
Inasmuch as there were more than 130 different foreign ethnic groups in Italy , it was clearly impossible to teach children from all those groups their language and culture of origin .
31 . In Italy as a whole , avoidance of compulsory secondary schooling had amounted to only 0.3 or 0.4 per cent , and 2 to 3 per cent in the poorest southern regions of the country .
A programme had been launched to address the question .
32 . Only 30 per cent of Italian university students graduated .
It had been found , however , that the drop-out rate was lower for subjects that required longer studies and were more difficult , for example medicine .
The drop-out rate seemed to be more closely linked to the attitude of the students than to the level of difficulty of their studies .
Another investigation had revealed that whereas only 37 per cent of university graduates found employment in line with their field of study , students generally regarded their university experience as having been useful from the point of view of enriching their general culture .
33 . As Italian universities were open to all persons who had a secondary school diploma , there were more university graduates than available employment in their fields of study .
To remedy that situation , the Government had launched a programme to improve career orientation , place more university graduates in jobs in the public sector and introduce a course of university training that lasted only two to three years and was better geared to the requirements of the labour market .
34 . Concerning linguistic minorities he said that special legislation had been adopted on the teaching of languages other than Italian that were spoken in border regions and in certain other areas of the country , and a degree of autonomy had also been granted in that regard .
Thus , children at pre-school level received instruction in both Italian and German in Alto Adige / Südtirol , in Italian and French in the Val d &apos;Aosta and in Italian and Slovene in Friuli-Venezia Giulia .
35 . The CHAIRMAN invited the members of the Committee to put questions to the Italian delegation .
36 . Mr. SPARSIS recalled that under the scala mobile the purchasing power of the working classes had been guaranteed .
He would like to know how the worker &apos;s standard of living was safeguarded now that the scala mobile had been abolished .
A lump-sum payment was inadequate in that regard and usually led to inflation .
37 . The right to strike was guaranteed to all except to the police and military . What alternatives were available to those bodies for the protection of their rights and interests , and was there a system of compulsory arbitration ? Were migrant workers covered by special legislation and collective agreements , and had Italy ratified any regional or international conventions guaranteeing to migrant workers the right to a decent living ?
38 . It had been said that the privatization of State enterprises made the rich richer and the poor poorer .
IMF had been an advocate of privatization but was now having second thoughts . Had any study been made of the situation in that respect in Italy ?
Finally , what kind of machinery existed in Italy for enforcing the legislation on the employment of children ?
39 . Mr. TEXIER noted that Italy &apos;s report was very complete with regard to the information provided on articles 13 to 15 of the Covenant but that there were large gaps in the information supplied on articles 6 to 9 and article 11 .
Italy had recently joined those countries which had agreed on the free circulation of persons within their frontiers .
Controls at the external frontiers of the group would , however , be intensified , with possible harmful consequences for the right of asylum .
In that connection he would like to know whether any amendments had been made to Italian legislation in respect of the rights of migrant workers .
40 . Assisted procreation posed problems of ethics and human rights . What was the situation in Italy and what measures had been taken to prevent abuses ?
41 . The Committee had available abundant documentation on the right to housing supplied by the Italian affiliate of Habitat International Coalition .
Recent changes in rent legislation appeared to reduce the protection given to tenants . What was the logic behind that , and was it connected with the policy of privatization ?
42 . Mr. WIMER ZAMBRANO said that he shared the misgivings expressed by Mr. Sparsis regarding privatization , in which the position of the workers generally deteriorated . What were the negative effects on the rights of workers in Italy ?
As far as the abuse of narcotic drugs was concerned , he noted that most countries prosecuted traffickers but not users , while a minority prosecuted users as well .
Some information on the legal situation in Italy , and in particular on the procedures for dealing with drug addicts , would be appreciated .
43 . Mrs. BONOAN-DANDAN noted that the question of housing had barely been dealt with in the report .
In that connection she would like to know whether there were any provisions to ensure that all persons living in Italy had access to affordable , safe , secure and adequate housing , what steps the Government had taken to protect non-nationals from discrimination in housing , how many migrant workers had been evicted , and how many of the 60,000 to 100,00 persons reported to be homeless were non-nationals .
44 . She would also like to know what kind of birth control methods were offered in family advice centres , what programmes , if any , existed for the dissemination of information on birth control , whether there was any legislation on abortion , what were the still-birth and infant mortality rates , particularly in the rural areas , what educational programmes were in place for religious instruction , and whether there was any censorship on the cinema , radio , television and press .
45 . Mr. MRATCHKOV expressed his surprise that the report devoted so very little attention to trade unions .
He asked what the present state of trade unions in Italy was , which were the most representative trade unions and how were they determined , whether trade union membership was rising or falling , whether military personnel and civil servants had the right to form and join trade unions , whether there was a strike law governing the private sector , what limitations there were on the right to strike , what procedures were in place for declaring strikes illegal , and whether there was any legislation on lock-outs .
46 . Mr. SIMMA thanked the Italian delegation for its heroic effort to make good the shortcomings in the report .
The delegation had indicated that there was de jure parity between national and migrant workers with regard to remuneration , safe and healthy working conditions and so on , but it was important to know what the de facto situation was .
For example , in Campania alone there appeared to be tens of thousands of Africans working in agriculture for very poor remuneration that must be below the minimum wage .
The de facto situation regarding wage-earners who might remain outside the system of minimum wages also required clarification .
47 . The Italian delegation had stated that day-care facilities were available .
There again , however , the Committee needed to know the de facto situation and whether all mothers who needed day-care facilities could find a place for their children and , if not , what percentage of them did not have access to such facilities .
48 . A good deal of information had been provided on the subject of divorce , possibly because the word &quot; abortion &quot; in paragraph 30 of the original English version of the list of issues had been mistakenly translated into French as divorce .
Consequently , some information on the situation with regard to abortion in Italy would be appreciated .
Moreover , no information had been given on family planning .
49 . With regard to the right to housing , which was not dealt with in the report at all , he would like to know why only 5 per cent of all housing in Italy was accounted for by public housing , whether the public agency responsible for housing was actually using the large sum of money at its disposal for the construction of public or other forms of housing , and what steps the national Government was taking to encourage the regional Governments to formulate regional housing policies .
Another striking factor about the housing situation in Italy was the very large number of uninhabited dwellings - more than 5 million in all . Why was the number of uninhabited housing units in cities such as Rome and Florence increasing , and would the new legislation referred to by Mr. Texier resolve the situation ?
Over 80 per cent of tenants were not covered by the equo canone law , and an equal percentage currently paid more than 40 per cent of their income on rent .
The new legislation would probably lead to a further increase . How did the Italian Government reconcile that situation with its obligation to secure the right to adequate housing for low-income workers ?
50 . Mr. KOUZNETSOV inquired about the adverse effects , if any , which the new situation that was due to arise within the European community in January 1993 would have on economic , social and cultural rights in Italy .
51 . Mr. RATTRAY asked whether the new initiatives taken for health care would be sufficient to meet the requirements of article 12 of the Covenant or whether a regression would occur .
52 . Mr. OATES ( International Labour Organisation ) drew attention to the information already supplied by ILO to the Committee .
Italy had ratified a large number of ILO conventions , many of which were relevant to the application of articles 6 to 10 of the Covenant .
53 . The ILO Employment Policy Convention ( No. 122 ) had been discussed in the ILO Conference Committee on the Application of Standards in 1991 , when the Government had given additional information concerning the earlier fall in the rate of unemployment from 12 per cent to 11 per cent and on the consultations taking place with workers &apos; and employees &apos; organizations as required by the Convention .
Nevertheless the ILO Committee had drawn attention to the need for the coordination of initiatives relating to training and education , on which the Government had been requested to supply more information .
The Committee had noted that so far the many active employment policy measures on which the Government had provided information had not seemed to resolve the employment problems in the country .
54 . With regard to article 7 of the Covenant , the Committee had raised another problem of coordination under ILO Labour Inspection Convention ( No. 81 ) .
It was not apparent that the necessary coordination existed between the national authorities and the local labour inspectorates , which often had other duties which distracted them from their obligation to ensure that labour legislation was applied .
The Committee of Experts had also taken account , under Convention No. 81 , of the comments made by a bank workers &apos; union concerning problems of application concerning the legislation relating to working time .
55 . In respect of article 9 of the Covenant , the Committee of Experts had noted the Government &apos;s position that the &quot; social pension &quot; was regarded as an assistance payment falling outside the scope also of the ILO Equality of Treatment Convention ( No. 118 ) .
The Committee had none the less pointed out that under the definition given in Convention No. 118 the &quot; social pension &quot; must be considered as being covered by it .
The Committee had also noted that the Government referred to discussions on larger pension questions at the level of the European Community , and it hoped that the Government would supply more information in its next report on that Convention .
56 . With regard to article 10 of the Covenant , he wished to underline the Committee &apos;s comments on the Minimum Age Conventions .
The outstanding problem was still the possibility that children below the prescribed minimum age for employment might be employed in agriculture .
The Committee had asked for information on whether children working in agriculture were limited to light work , as required by the Convention .
57 . Mrs. IDER asked to what extent and in what manner non-nationals were not guaranteed the rights recognized in the Covenant , what justification there was for any difficulties , and what limitations might be imposed upon the exercise of the rights set forth in articles 6 to 15 of the Covenant and the reasons therefor .
58 . With regard to the protection of the family , mothers and children , she would like to know who paid the wages during maternity leave , the employer or the State , whether there were any women who did not enjoy maternity protection and , if so , what measures were being adopted to remedy that situation , and whether there were any groups of children and young persons who did not enjoy the measures of protection and assistance at all or who did so to a significantly lesser degree than the majority .
The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.

CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS ( agenda item 5 ) ( continued )
( a ) REPORTS SUBMITTED BY STATES PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLES 16 AND 17 OF THE COVENANT ( continued )
France ( E / 1989 / 5 / Add.1 )
2 . The CHAIRMAN welcoming the French delegation , said some explanation was due to it for the length of time the Committee had taken to consider the additional information provided by France in April 1989 shortly after its second report had been considered by the Committee at its third session .
As the Committee and its pre-sessional working group were still feeling their way towards developing a proper procedure for dealing with additional information , the revised recommendations relating to the second report had only been ready in time for a French response at the sixth session of the Committee in 1991 .
That consideration had been postponed to the present session at the request of the French Government .
3 . Mr. CHOURAQUI ( France ) said that in responding to the recommendations regarding the additional information it had submitted ( E / C.12 / WG / 1991 / CRP.12 ) France was acting in accordance with its long-held view that the principles enshrined in the Covenants had no value unless they were given practical expression and provided , moreover , that undertakings made by States were duly monitored and periodically reviewed .
France had submitted its second report on articles 10 to 12 of the Covenant in October 1987 ; on 14 February 1989 , when the Committee had considered that report , the French representative had drawn attention to the far-reaching changes and considerable progress that had taken place in France since its initial submission .
A further report ( E / 1989 / 5 / Add.1 ) describing in detail those changes had been submitted to the Committee in April 1989 .
The French Government had asked for consideration of that report to be postponed from the sixth to the present session of the Committee in order to permit the responses to the Committee &apos;s recommendations on that report to be made by an inter-ministerial delegation from Paris competent to respond to any specific question the Committee might wish to put .
4 . He would refer briefly to several points covered in the report , indicating the changes that had taken place in the interim period , in particular with regard to family benefits and differences in income levels between metropolitan France and the French Overseas Departments and Territories .
Government policy had , for a number of years , been directed to levelling out those differences and providing equal treatment wherever possible in response to the wish to that effect expressed by the President of the Republic. page
5 . The report indicated the distinction to be drawn between the Overseas Departments ( DOM ) and the Overseas Territories ( TOM ) .
The status of the Overseas Departments had been governed by the principle of legislative assimilation since the adoption of the 1946 Constitution , which meant that all legislation and regulations were applicable in the Overseas Departments without any specific provision being required .
That had been the framework within which the employment requirement for the payment of family allowances in the Overseas Departments ( beginning with the first child ) had been abolished .
Since April 1989 , the employment requirement had also been abolished for all other family benefits , including the family supplement , the special education allowance and the family support allowance .
The cost of those measures , as detailed in the report , was of course large but the Government had considered it an essential step towards equality in social welfare .
Social and family allowances would be fully brought into line with those paid in metropolitan France not later than 1 January 1995 , under an Act adopted on 31 July 1991 .
The Overseas Departments , however , retained one more favourable component , the first child benefit .
By 1 July 1992 , 57.5 per cent of the discrepancy in family benefit had been absorbed and full parity would be achieved during 1993 , despite the considerable financial burden involved .
6 . The report also provided details of the minimum income for reintegration purposes ( RMI ) provided in the Overseas Departments .
There had been no significant change in that area since , apart from an increase in the amounts involved to 1,779 francs a month for a single person and 2,669 francs a month for a two-person household , plus 534 francs a month for each additional person , equal to 80 per cent of the figures for metropolitan France .
The cost of RMI in 1991 was 180,000 francs .
During the past three years the Government had also continued its policy of reintegration , with particular emphasis on health , illiteracy programmes , vocational training , housing subsidies and home improvement in collaboration with bodies with expertise in those fields .
In 1991 , 640 million francs had been spent by the State as its contribution to reintegration .
7 . The Government had referred in its report to the establishment of an exploratory commission to ensure the achievement of social equality between metropolitan France and the Overseas Departments .
The Commission had conducted its work in 1989 , in cooperation with elected representatives and officials of the Overseas Departments , and prepared the Ripert Report on which the Government &apos;s further work in the area was being based .
8 . The Overseas Territories , under article 74 of the Constitution , had a unique form of administration defined by law in the light of their own interests in accordance with the principle of &quot; legislative specialization &quot; .
Many areas of administration came under the competence of the Territories , although the State continued to intervene when measures taken by the Territories proved inadequate or when the Government wished to ensure the implementation of certain economic and social rights , for which purpose the State concluded agreements with the Territory concerned for that purpose .
In addition to the agreements listed in the report , the 1980 Agreement between the State and the Territory of French Polynesia had been extended on 16 February 1991 to include State assistance for the elderly and a further agreement had been concluded on 2 July 1992 between the State and the Territory of Wallis and Futuna on the same subject .
9 . Turning to article 10 of the Covenant , he said that the figures for the minimum income for reintegration purposes ( RMI ) given in the report had since been increased to 2,224.11 francs for a single person and 3,336 francs for two persons to compensate for increases in the cost of living and ensure that all continued to enjoy a minimum standard of living .
10 . With regard to the guaranteed minimum wage ( SMIG ) , where levels in metropolitan France and in the Overseas Departments had long been unequal , a process leading to the elimination of the SMIG shortfall in Reunion and French Guyana had been initiated in July 1990 and completed by 1 January 1992 .
On 1 July 1992 , the SMIG level had been 29.50 francs in the Overseas Departments as opposed to 34.00 francs in metropolitan France .
The shortfall had thus fallen from 22 per cent in 1987 to 13 per cent in 1992 , a not inconsiderable achievement ; full equality was expected by 1 January 1995 .
France &apos;s determination to establish full equality in that area between the Overseas Departments and metropolitan France was thus clearly evident .
11 . Since the additional information had been provided , France had made further provision for child welfare with the adoption on 12 July 1990 of an Act to protect children employed as models .
During the past 20 years , increasing use had been made of children in advertising .
However , although the conditions under which children could be employed in the performing arts was regulated by the Labour Code , there were no regulations concerning children employed as photographic models in advertising or taking part in fashion shows .
In order to fill that legal loophole , the new Act set out the conditions regulating model agencies and , furthermore , accorded children working for advertising agencies the same protection as was extended to children employed in the performing arts .
Copies of that Act were available for members of the Committee .
12 . The CHAIRMAN thanked the representative of France for his statement .
In the absence of any comments or questions from its members , it was evident that the Committee was entirely satisfied .
The Government of France was to be congratulated on the serious and detailed manner in which it had responded to the points raised by the Committee .
Netherlands ( E / 1989 / 5 / Add.2 )
14 . At the invitation of the Chairman , Mr. Boddens-Hosang and Ms. Wolters ( Netherlands ) took places at the Committee table .
15 . The CHAIRMAN , welcoming the Netherlands delegation , said that the reasons for the delay in considering the additional information provided by the Netherlands in 1989 had been largely the same as for the French report , namely the time taken to develop adequate procedures for processing such information within the Committee .
16 . Mr. BODDENS-HOSANG ( Netherlands ) recalled that on 15 February 1989 the Committee had considered the second periodic report of the Netherlands on articles 6 to 12 of the Covenant and the report of the Netherlands Antilles on articles 13 to 15 of the Covenant .
An impressive list of questions on those reports had previously been submitted to the Netherlands authorities .
On the basis of those questions , the Netherlands delegation had at that session enjoyed a lengthy and fruitful dialogue with the Committee , in particular on Netherlands government policy on the creation of employment , the social security system , proposals for restructuring the health system and on narcotic drugs .
Four questions on the right to housing had not been answered on that occasion but replies had been provided in a note to the Committee dated 27 June 1989 .
Although dating from three years previously , those answers had not lost their validity .
Should the answers to the questions give rise to any further queries by the Committee , the Netherlands Government was fully prepared to discuss them either in a separate note or to include them in its forthcoming report to the Committee .
17 . The CHAIRMAN invited the members of the Committee to put questions to the delegation of the Netherlands .
18 . Mr. SIMMA suggested that the Committee should begin by hearing the comments of the Netherlands on the recommendations of the pre-sessional working group concerning the additional information submitted by the Government of the Netherlands ( E / C.12 / WG / 1991 / CRP.13 ) , as revised by hand .
19 . Mr. BODDENS-HOSANG ( Netherlands ) said that his delegation had only received knowledge of that document in a very informal fashion , but never officially .
Nevertheless , the document had been passed on to the relevant authorities .
He suggested that his Government could either include the information requested in a subsequent report or submit it to the Committee in a separate note at a later date .
20 . Mr. SIMMA said that in view of the procedural confusion , the Committee should ask the Netherlands to include the information requested in its next report .
He also noted that paragraph 3 of the recommendations was unclear and might give rise to the wrong interpretation .
21 . The CHAIRMAN said that he regretted that the recommendations of the pre-sessional working group had not been officially submitted to the Netherlands .
The Committee had no choice but to proceed as Mr. Simma had suggested .
He therefore asked the delegation of the Netherlands to take formal note of document E / C.12 / WG / 1991 / CRP.13 and requested the Government of the Netherlands to include a discussion of the information requested in it in its next report .
22 . Mr. TEXIER said that the Committee must ensure that the procedure for requesting additional information was made clear by the end of the current session .
He wondered why the Government of the Netherlands had not been officially asked to respond .
The problem must be resolved , because the Committee &apos;s credibility was at stake .
23 . The CHAIRMAN agreed .
The procedure for requesting and considering additional information had not yet been adequately defined .
He noted that the Committee had on its agenda a proposal for improving that procedure .
24 . On behalf of the Committee he thanked the delegation of the Netherlands for their cooperation with the Committee and looked forward to receiving the additional information which the delegation had undertaken to provide .
25 . Mr. Boddans-Hosang and Ms. Wolters ( Netherlands ) withdrew .
The meeting was suspended at 11.10 a.m. and resumed at 11.45 a.m.
Jordan ( E / 1989 / 5 / Add.6 )
27 . Mr. TALHOUNI ( Jordan ) said that his Government attached particular importance to the Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and to the monitoring work of the Committee .
Jordan had been in the forefront of efforts to promote economic , social , cultural and educational rights .
The country was not rich in natural resources , and its citizens were thus its most valuable asset .
The Jordanian Government had constantly endeavoured to develop its human resources so that the country would thrive .
Time had proved the validity of that approach : Jordan had advanced technologically and scientifically in all fields , reaching levels that even some rich countries had been unable to attain .
It had emerged as a centre for medical treatment and education serving citizens from neighbouring States .
Educated Jordanians had become the country &apos;s capital and wealth , and neighbouring countries sought to attract them so as to benefit from their expertise .
The earnings of educated Jordanians represented an important part of Jordan &apos;s economy and a major source of budget revenue .
28 . Under the Constitution , power was divided between the legislative , executive and judicial branches .
Members of Parliament were directly elected by the citizens ; senators were appointed by the King .
The role of the judiciary was to protect the rights of citizens in general , and it was completely independent .
International treaties ratified by Jordan took precedence over domestic legislation .
In the human rights field , over the past few years Jordan had become a party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , the Convention on the Rights of the Child , the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid , the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women , the Convention on the Political Rights of Women , and the Convention on Consent to Marriage , Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages .
Jordan was , in fact , one of the countries in which democracy and human rights were practised in their best forms .
29 . The efforts to protect economic , social and cultural rights had encountered a number of difficulties due to the lack of resources , particularly since the financial assistance formerly received from certain other States had declined .
Nevertheless , Jordan had adapted its economy to the new situation , reaching agreements with creditors , paying off debts with local products and implementing the IMF &apos;s recommendation that the volume of imports should be decreased .
30 . In recent years Jordan had taken in over 300,000 returnees from the Gulf States , representing an increase of nearly 10 per cent in its population .
As a result , schools were having difficulty in absorbing the 72,000 extra pupils , rents had risen , as well as the cost of living in general , and development projects had been disrupted .
Unfortunately , the latest available statistics had been prepared in 1990 , before the influx of returnees from the Gulf .
The Committee would be supplied with new statistics reflecting the current situation as soon as they had been compiled .
31 . According to a recent study , in 1991 the unemployment rate had been 18.8 per cent , varying greatly from one part of the country to another .
A large proportion of the unemployed had high educational qualifications .
Owing to the Gulf war and its after-effects , the number of requests for Jordanian workers received from other countries had declined .
32 . Income from the use of the Aqaba port had fallen off sharply as a result of the end of trade with Iraq .
Whereas 20 million tonnes of cargo had passed through it in 1988 , the total volume so far in 1992 had been only 14 million tonnes .
The port was currently operating at only 60 per cent of its capacity , and many workers had had to be dismissed .
Exports of phosphates had decreased by 33 per cent over the past three years as a result of the Gulf crisis and the difficult economic situation in eastern Europe .
On the other hand many returnees from the Gulf had brought large sums of money with them , and hard currency bank deposits in Jordan had risen from US $ 1.4 billion in February 1991 to US $ 3.2 billion in July 1992 .
33 . Jordan was committed to achieving the IMF targets and had reduced its budget deficit to below the figure recommended by the Fund .
The action taken in that respect had , however , led to increased unemployment .
34 . The Committee had asked certain questions regarding education in Jordan .
Up-to-date statistics would be provided soon .
The most important point was that free and compulsory education was guaranteed by the Constitution , regardless of religion , origin or sex .
The period of compulsory education was now 10 years , based on a national policy formulated in 1988 .
Education policy was not subject to any military or emergency measures .
Great progress had , in fact , been achieved in education .
Schools had been built in all parts of the country , 35 per cent of the population was enrolled in some kind of educational institution , and the illiteracy rate had fallen from 64 per cent in 1962 to 20 per cent in 1989 .
Education had not been affected by the events of 1989 .
Premises had been rebuilt , school staffs had been kept intact , and in general the crisis had been overcome .
Although the working week had been reduced to five days and cars could be used for only three days a week , school hours had not changed .
The Government had affirmed its commitment to implement education development programmes , and the budget for education amounted to nearly 8.5 per cent of the total national budget and had increased rapidly over the past three years .
Arabic was the mother tongue of the entire population .
35 . Most replies to the questions put by the Committee were to be found in document E / 1989 / 5 / Add.6.
However , he would now like to take up some of the queries which had not yet been dealt with in detail .
36 . The mass media had informed citizens about the international human rights instruments to which Jordan was a party , including the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .
The Government also publicized , through the press and through seminars in which the various sectors of Jordanian society participated , the contents of the reports submitted to human rights treaty bodies .
Sequences from the seminars were broadcast on radio and television so that as many citizens as possible could become aware of what took place at them .
The Ministry of Education had also organized a monthly one-hour class in which lectures were given on different aspects of human rights and the various international instruments ratified by Jordan .
Each month a different theme was chosen , such as political rights , the rights of the child , economic and social rights , or the rights of women .
The international instruments related to the theme were explained so as to allow students at different levels to absorb fully their meaning .
In the universities , seminars were held on all aspects of human rights , with exchanges of views between academics , legal experts , students and all those interested in the subject ; the rights of citizens resulting from Jordan &apos;s ratification of a large number of human rights instruments , including the Covenant , were discussed at length .
A number of programmes discussed economic , social and cultural problems , such as that which explained economic rights linked to or emanating from the Covenant while others focused on the awareness of citizens of their economic and cultural rights , in order to exchange views and educate the public .
Questions came from every part of Jordan and from various sectors of society , so that the views of Jordanian citizens were reflected extensively .
37 . Replying to the questions about the effect of the Jordanian external debt on rights provided for in the Covenant , he said that there had been a slow-down in building further schools and expanding existing ones .
Six new national universities had been set up since the beginning of 1990 .
The rapid increase in the number of universities attested to the Government &apos;s efforts to provide university education for all who would benefit from it , particularly since the capacity of the three government universities to absorb students was insufficient in the context of the large population increase and the current economic situation .
The Government had therefore allowed the private sector to establish national universities .
38 . The State guaranteed the right of all citizens to enjoy the cultural life of their choice .
Cultural seminars , clubs and meeting places were open to all Jordanian citizens irrespective of their religion , race or national origin , and participation was open to all .
There were certain clubs for ethnic minorities , such as Circassians , Chechens , Armenians and Syrians where cultural and sports activities were carried on as well as activities aimed at maintaining the minorities &apos; national heritage .
Christian Arabs had national societies and social clubs in every part of the country , the most important being the Orthodox Club .
There were also special schools for Christian citizens , imparting the standard government curricula and in addition special religious classes for the children of each religious group and sometimes classes in a foreign language such as French .
Those schools were open to all and some Moslem citizens sent their children to them .
The Moslem population also had special schools in which the same curricula were used as in government schools in addition to classes in language .
In most government schools there was further Islamic education : those schools were open to all children and in some there were Christian students .
The Ministry of Education had tried to bring the content and methods of education into line with the developments of the age : it had increased the number of subjects taught , including computer technology , music and artistic expression , and made them available to all pupils in the Jordanian State .
39 . Creative and artistic freedom were covered by article 15 of the Jordanian Constitution under which every Jordanian could express his opinion freely in writing and photography and all forms of expression provided he stayed within the law .
Treatment was provided also outside the country at State expense when the treatment required was not available in Jordanian hospitals .
41 . He hoped that he had fully answered the Committee &apos;s questions .
42 . The CHAIRMAN , thanking the Jordanian representative for his comprehensive statement , said that the Committee had no further questions at present .
He congratulated the Government of Jordan on the way in which it had answered the points raised by the Committee .
Philippines ( E / 1989 / 5 / Add.7 )
44 . At the invitation of the Chairman , Mr. Villaroel and Ms. Bernaditas ( Philippines ) took places at the Committee table .
45 . The CHAIRMAN asked whether the delegation of the Philippines wished to answer the two questions raised by the pre-sessional working group or to include their answers in their country &apos;s next report .
46 . Mr. VILLAROEL ( Philippines ) said that he preferred to include the answers in his country &apos;s next report .
47 . The CHAIRMAN commended the Philippines delegation for the extensive information they had submitted in writing .
48 . Mr. VILLAROEL ( Philippines ) said that he had prepared a short statement updating the Philippines report , but would prefer , instead of delivering it , to distribute copies to the Committee .
49 . The CHAIRMAN thanked the delegation of the Philippines for their cooperation with the Committee .
50 . Mr. Villaroel and Ms. Bernaditas ( Philippines ) withdrew .
51 . The CHAIRMAN noted that the recommendations by the pre-sessional working group concerning Panama had not been adopted and forwarded to the Government of Panama .
Since none were in the form of requests for further information but were rather statements to the effect that certain issues had not been dealt with , he suggested that one member of the Committee should follow the discussion at the next meeting when the representative of Panama would be present and identify issues still outstanding at the end of the meeting to enable the Committee to adopt the relevant recommendations of the working group .
52 . After a procedural discussion in which the CHAIRMAN and Mr. SIMMA participated , Mrs. BONOAN-DANDAN volunteered to monitor the discussion on Panama .
The meeting rose at 1 p.m.

GENERAL DISCUSSION ON THE RIGHT TO TAKE PART IN CULTURAL LIFE AS RECOGNIZED IN ARTICLE 15 OF THE COVENANT ( agenda item 6 ) ( E / C.12 / 1992 / WP.4 )
1 . The CHAIRMAN called for a volunteer to draft a report on the general discussion on item 6 .
2 . Mrs. IDER expressed her willingness to carry out that assignment .
3 . The CHAIRMAN invited Mr. Konate to introduce the paper he had prepared on the implementation of cultural rights and an analysis of article 15 of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( E / C.12 / 1992 / WP.4 ) .
4 . Mr. KONATE , introducing his paper , said that it would have been helpful if it had been available in all working languages .
At the same time , he apologized that the text was not complete , technical difficulties having arisen .
5 . The paper began by noting that cultural rights and , indeed , economic and social rights as well , were in a sense &quot; underdeveloped &quot; , largely because of a lack of clarity about their legal nature and content .
There was a tendency to emphasize external manifestations of culture , such as libraries , museums , works of art and the like . Yet as early as the 1970s , UNESCO had underscored the importance of the right both to take part in cultural life and to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress , an approach that he shared .
6 . The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights gave little attention to a definition of cultural rights .
Instruments of culture were often equated with culture itself .
In his view , it was not enough to restrict the definition to external aspects of culture . Such a definition was materialist or even mercantilist .
Instead , culture was at the very core of human rights , because it was human dignity and , indeed , life itself that were concerned .
Referring to the example of the colonialist period , he said that the first human right that had been denied was the right to culture , and that had opened the way to a denial of all other human rights .
7 . Thus , a semantic question arose : could the right to take part in cultural life be equated with the right to culture ?
With a view to expanding the scope of article 15 , he had sought to reconcile the right to take part in cultural life , which was a right of the individual , and the right to culture , which might be regarded as a group right .
8 . One area on which his paper focused was the right to have access to culture and the need for equal opportunities and non-discrimination in that regard .
Furthermore , as recognized in article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , &quot; Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community &quot; , and that meant that participation must not be imposed page by the authorities in implementation of a cultural policy .
The right of access to culture also entailed the freedom to engage in creative activity , access to means of dissemination and protection of the cultural and artistic heritage .
Individuals must have the right to be involved in defining cultural policy choices .
That was implied in the right to take part in cultural life .
9 . The rights of minorities were of particular concern in the overall approach to culture .
That was an aspect that had not received sufficient attention in the past , and article 15 of the Covenant made no mention of the subject .
As recent events had shown , the cultural rights of minorities had taken on increased importance .
In his view , the Committee should give priority to considering ways to protect the cultural rights of minorities .
10 . In his paper he also addressed the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications , considered the concept of freedom to engage in scientific research and touched upon the question of censorship .
He also raised the question of ensuring equal access for all to scientific and technological progress .
In that context , it would be worth considering what States were undertaking to generalize such access .
11 . The limits of scientific progress , particularly from the ethical point of view , were another subject examined in the report .
He had in mind such areas as genetics and medicine , and he also referred in that connection to the conflict between the positivist approach contained in the idea of technical progress and the right to environmental protection .
The Committee might discuss what measures were taken to protect the environment and to prevent a repetition of the Chernobyl and Bhopal accidents .
Perhaps it was necessary to require proof that scientific progress provided benefits for mankind , an idea that was already implied in article 15 , paragraph 1 ( b ) .
12 . Turning to Part II of the paper , on measures to be taken by States parties to ensure implementation of cultural rights , reference was made to the Recommendation of Nairobi , adopted unanimously by UNESCO , on participation by the people at large in cultural life and their contribution to it , which was annexed .
As the States that had signed the Recommendation had committed themselves to reporting on their efforts to ensure access to culture , the Committee should request States to provide information on such activities .
13 . Turning to Part III of the paper on obstacles to the realization of cultural rights , he said that scientific progress should be assessed as a function of economic and social development .
When States were undertaking economic development programmes , they should stress the aspect of culture .
It was also important in that context to consider the extent to which the implementation of cultural rights was linked to education .
Many States were unable to guarantee realization of article 13 of the Covenant because of high illiteracy rates .
Education must play a role in ensuring access to culture .
14 . Part IV of the paper raised the question of the degree to which States should encourage and develop cultural cooperation and referred in that context to UNESCO &apos;s concept of the world cultural heritage .
It was worth considering , for example , whether a State could be obliged to establish a monument to an aspect of its cultural heritage and whether it could demand assistance in that endeavour from the international community .
15 . Part V of the paper , containing his recommendations , would be made available to the Committee as soon as possible .
16 . Mrs. BONOAN-DANDAN fully agreed with Mr. Konate that culture was not the same as cultural manifestations and that the right to culture was not the same as the right to participate in cultural life , the latter applying to individuals and the former to collectivities .
However , perhaps Mr. Konate &apos;s most interesting remark had been his assertion that culture was at the centre of human rights , with which she agreed .
17 . In the world of the humanities and social sciences in which she moved , culture simply meant a way of life .
Its elements would be language , non-verbal communication , oral and written literature , song , religion or belief systems which included rites and ceremonies , material culture , including methods of production or technology , livelihoods , the natural and man-made environment , food , clothing , shelter , the arts , customs and traditions consisting of practices , behaviour and institutions which reflected the norms of social order by which members of the community abided freely , plus a world view representing the totality of a person &apos;s encounter with the external forces affecting his life and that of his community .
Those fundamental elements of culture distinguished man from beasts .
Culture at the same time mirrored and shaped the economic , social , civil and political life of a community .
It was handed down from one generation to the next in a process of teaching and learning called &quot; education &quot; .
Participation in cultural life , at the very core of which lay a person &apos;s duties and responsibilities towards the common good , gave the individual a sense of belonging and reinforced his sense of identity .
18 . Participation in cultural life meant giving as much as taking .
If the Committee accepted the general definition of culture accepted in the social sciences , it was only logical to accept that taking part in cultural life embraced all the activities of the individual .
Culture was a birthright .
If it were possible to stop at that point , the sailing would be very smooth .
However , since the Committee was reflecting on cultural life in relation to its work , it must proceed into more dangerous and murky waters .
Customs and traditions gave rise to values and practices that were peculiar to a given culture .
In many cases such values could be translated into universally accepted norms , but in just as many cases specific customs and traditions ran counter to them .
In extreme cases they even violated human rights .
The question , then , of universality , specificity and relativity appeared to lead to a dead-end .
19 . She had once conducted a study in the South-East Asian region for UNESCO , focusing on human rights and education , among other matters .
People had flinched when they had heard the term &quot; human rights &quot; , and each time she had used it no cooperation had been forthcoming .
She had soon realized that if she wanted to achieve her objective , some alternative was called for .
From that point onwards she had replaced the term &quot; human rights &quot; by another .
The change had produced truly edifying findings , since her new concept had been deeply entrenched in age-old traditions applied to educational philosophy in all the South-East Asian cultures .
In the end she had been informed that although the West might have invented &quot; human rights &quot; , it did not hold a copyright on them .
20 . What lesson , then , could be learnt from that experience ?
In her view it was time to adopt creative approaches in the Committee &apos;s task of monitoring the compliance of States parties with their obligations under the Covenant .
The Committee should squarely face the fact that taking part in cultural life would always be relative if the Committee insisted on approaching it in its own terms .
That might , in fact , be one of the reasons why some States parties found it difficult to submit reports or did so only with the greatest reluctance . Why did the Committee not try asking States parties to cite their own cultural indicators , which the Committee could then compare with the ones it itself used ?
If any discrepancy were found , it should be pointed out to the State party concerned so that some mutually agreed common ground could be discovered .
The process would be rough sailing , and the problems would not be solved overnight .
She was not proposing that the Committee should allow States parties to decide entirely how they should present their reports , but the Committee could perhaps draft questions of a general nature regarding cultural life designed to elicit responses that would admit of concepts peculiar to a particular culture .
That would even be of greater value for the Committee &apos;s understanding of States parties &apos; situations .
Universality was meaningless as an abstract term .
The right to take part in cultural life was concrete and real and was the basis of all human rights and fundamental freedoms .
It should not be left in limbo .
21 . Mr. WIMER-ZAMBRANO thanked Mr. Konate for his sensible and imaginative text .
The proposals were not very specific and could not be so because culture covered so many different fields .
It had , in fact , been affirmed that culture was impossible to define except in absolutely conventional terms , since the word had many different meanings .
Consequently , it would be wrong for the Committee to try to arrive at a definition .
To avoid getting bogged down , the Committee should endeavour to decide what its goals were in the matter of cultural rights .
He personally was sceptical about the usefulness of arriving at a definition acceptable to all members of the Committee , since even if such a miracle were to occur , the Committee &apos;s conclusions would probably not be acceptable elsewhere .
A dogmatic or scholarly approach would therefore be inappropriate .
The word &quot; culture &quot; would continue to be used in different ways , but the Committee should use it in a restrictive sense within the limits of its mandate , taking into consideration the specific activities of States parties and justiciable acts - in other words concentrating more on the negative than on the positive aspects .
For example , if a certain people had certain traditions , it would be very difficult to request the Government to organize the relevant events , but it would be easy to request it not to interfere with them .
22 . Ms. HAUSERMANN ( International Movement for Rights and Humanity ) , speaking at the invitation of the Chairman , congratulated Mr. Konate on his very full analysis of the three aspects of article 15 of the Covenant .
She would concentrate on the first - the right to take part in cultural life .
Even that was an extremely broad right , having in many ways an impact on many other rights .
It was clearly linked to the rights associated with the development of the human potential and with those associated with survival and with the right to physical security , as in the Rushdie case .
Genocide might be the most extreme form of violation of cultural rights , in so far as it denied cultural identity .
It was also clear that the denial of cultural and national identity was a leading cause of major conflicts such as those taking place in the former Yugoslavia .
23 . An analysis of the right to participate in cultural life also revealed other linkages between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights on the other - for example , between the rights to freedom of expression , to freedom of assembly , to freedom of thought and religion , and to education .
If the definition of &quot; culture &quot; was extremely difficult , the definition of &quot; cultural life &quot; was also difficult and inevitably contained many subjective elements .
However , it went far beyond &quot; high culture &quot; and the arts and clearly included food , languages , religion , music , dance and traditional activities and rituals .
For indigenous peoples and many others it affected their very survival and way of life .
For them cultural life could not be separated from a mutual support system , and those who were denied access to participation in cultural life might therefore be denied the very opportunity to live .
Many attempts had been made to define cultural life .
It clearly embraced those elements which specifically identified a particular community , but the cultural rights of that community did not exist in isolation and were constantly developing .
In Europe the right of access raised very serious issues regarding physical disabilities and financing , since if culture was to be accessible to everyone , it must also be affordable .
25 . The protection of minorities had given rise to particular problems in Europe , concerning not only the protection of minority groups in the dominant culture but also their rights to develop and participate in their own cultures . In multicultural societies , that in itself raised many issues .
Artistic freedom and freedom of expression and all the rights associated with the freedom to disseminate ideas and with education were much more clearly defined .
26 . With regard to the right to participate in cultural policy-making , her organization had found that on some occasions government policies had prevented participation in cultural life .
For example , in Finland the Sami minority had a very distinct culture , and the Government had provided financial support for its artistic and cultural expression .
The consequences of that policy , however , had been to limit the development of the Sami culture and to turn it more into a tourist attraction - a &quot; museumization &quot; of culture , as it were .
Thus , the protection of minorities was clearly a major issue in the right to take part in cultural life .
27 . A broader view showed some of the problems that had emerged in her organization &apos;s research .
In western Europe the question of separate schools with different languages had arisen , as had that of State support for religious schools for minorities .
The case in France of the Muslim girl who wished to wear a veil in school had attracted considerable attention .
Very difficult policy , as well as legal , issues were involved .
The question as to when cultural practices themselves might be considered a violation of other rights also arose , as in the case of female circumcision .
In that connection , her organization would argue that any cultural practice that was damaging to health or to the enjoyment of other human rights could not be regarded as part of the right to participate in cultural life .
In central and eastern Europe cultural life had been used so much as a means of expression that popular participation had been very high .
Yet with political and economic restructuring and the inability of Governments to continue funding artistic institutions , there had been a dramatic decline in opportunities to participate in cultural life .
28 . Her organization was very conscious of the whole question of national and cultural identity and its relationship with the right to self-determination .
Mrs. Bonoan-Dandan had stated that culture represented part of an individual &apos;s world view .
In that respect some striking developments had taken place in Europe with regard to respect for cultural rights .
For instance , States wishing to join the Council of Europe had an obligation to adhere to both the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Cultural Convention .
29 . She hoped that at the Committee &apos;s next session she would be able to make a brief report on the conclusions reached at the conference which her organization was preparing to hold and to make some suggestions on the nature of State obligations and on how States could deal with the complex issues raised by the right to participate in cultural life .
The conclusions would be placed under three main headings : what the State had to do in terms of legal protection , how a State protected individuals from violations by others , and what measures a State needed to take to ensure the progressive achievement of the right to participate in cultural life for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sections of society . That included State subsidies for art , the protection of minorities , and measures to ensure access to culture for the disabled .
The conference would also be considering the question of international cooperation and the obligations of States in that connection .
Since those issues involved both policy and law , the conference would be attended by human rights lawyers , European policy makers , and representatives of UNESCO and the Council of Europe .
30 . Mr. MRATCHKOV , said he had been struck by the elegant legal analysis and humanitarian aspect of Mr. Konate &apos;s paper , including a certain human warmth which was not always present in the Committee &apos;s comments on reports submitted by Governments .
The rights set out in article 15 were complex ; three distinct rights were listed , and Mr. Konate believed that from them derived a corollary concerning the right of protection of the material and moral interests of authors .
What had to be stressed was the extreme complexity of rights which opened up a whole social , legal and human universe .
31 . He noted that States parties to the Covenant had an obligation to take legislative , administrative and other measures to ensure that the rights set forth in the Covenant were applied in practice .
The Committee , when examining the report of States parties , was always interested in the practical application of rights ; with regard to article 15 , the Committee had two additional reasons to be interested .
First , there was the non-self-executing nature of the rights set forth in article 15 , which required States to take legislative or other measures to make sure that those rights were applied .
There were many and varying degrees of non-self-executing rights in the Covenant ; some rights , such as those in articles 11 and 15 , were more non-self-executing than others .
The justiciability of those non-self-executing rights depended on their introduction into the legal order ; if the right was not introduced into the domestic legal order the question of justiciability did not arise .
The Committee needed to focus particular attention on the regulation of those rights .
Second there was the current economic recession .
Cultural rights were among the most vulnerable ; they were the first to be sacrificed when States experienced economic difficulties .
The practical aspect therefore had to receive greater attention .
32 . Reverting to the concept of participation in cultural life , he noted that there were three clearly differentiated aspects listed in article 15 .
The fundamental right to participation in cultural life as set forth in paragraph 1 ( a ) had two components .
The first was the right to the creation of cultural values , literary , artistic and scientific : in a word , spiritual values .
The result of that creation distinguished that right from all other economic rights which resulted in material products .
The second component was the right to benefit from cultural values created by the individual or the community .
Participation in cultural life thus included both the right to artistic , literary and scientific creation and the right to enjoy the benefits created by it .
33 . He noted that Mr. Konate had raised the question of whether those rights were individual or collective .
The right to create spiritual values was by its very nature more often individual than collective , but the right to benefit from spiritual values could be both individual and collective .
34 . Lastly , he raised the question of international cooperation on the rights set forth in article 15 , which he considered to involve consultation between the Committee and other specialized agencies in that sphere .
He was gratified to see that the representative of UNESCO was present and regretted that the latter had not been able to attend when the Committee had considered the five reports submitted under agenda item 5 , four of which had related to articles 13 to 15 .
Furthermore , WIPO might be invited to be present when the Committee considered the right of protection of authors &apos; material and moral interests .
35 . Mr. ZACHARIEV ( United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ) , apologized for not having been able to follow the earlier discussions , since UNESCO was undergoing restructuring and had to limit its activities in accordance with its resources .
The Committee &apos;s recommendations would therefore be very useful as a basis to enable UNESCO to identify areas for practical action , although a distinction always had to be made between charters , declarations and conventions between UNESCO and States parties on one hand and on the other , recommendations by committees of experts that did not necessarily reflect the opinion of legal experts or representatives of States , a fact which might preclude UNESCO from taking concrete action .
36 . As Mr. Konate had stressed in his paper , UNESCO was trying to go beyond the materialistic vision of culture , to one that included every aspect of the creativity of individuals and groups , both in their style of life and in their mode of practical activity .
Lately UNESCO had been emphasizing all the ethical aspects of human life vis-à-vis the problems posed by progress in science , technology and economic development in general , which coincided with the Committee &apos;s concerns .
He welcomed the Committee &apos;s emphasis on increased interdependence between cultural development and development in general , which made possible continuous and increasing information on the specificities of development without neglecting cultural aspects inherent in different cultural identities .
UNESCO shared the Committee &apos;s concern to avoid a turning inward and cultural prejudices , and to find the means of more effective international cooperation that would enable it to fulfil its role .
Cooperation could be strengthened with other agencies such as WIPO to realize the human aspects of development .
A series of statements and actions emphasizing the priority given by UNESCO to culture , placing different aspects of morality in the centre of its thought and action , would enable UNESCO better to meet the concerns of the Economic and Social Council , which in its most recent session the previous July had laid stress on human resources .
One of UNESCO &apos;s fundamental missions was to draw out the potential of each people to develop the culture of peace at the expense of the culture of war .
That mission was linked with the agenda for peace which had been announced by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in July 1992 .
Along with the emphasis on culture and morality , a special role had been assigned to education and training to ensure the sharing of knowledge to give culture pride of place in national development strategies .
37 . In 1982 UNESCO had convened the World Conference on Cultural Policies in Mexico ; since then there had been new developments , stemming from the World Decade for Cultural Development , with a dynamic evolution of the concept of culture and human rights .
A number of current UNESCO programmes would contribute to the practical realization of cultural development and , in particular , of education .
UNESCO had recently been giving considerable attention to democracy and human rights , including the right to culture ; with the generous support of the Canadian Government it intended to organize an international congress on democracy and human rights in March 1993 .
Seminars on the cultural dimension of development had been held at the headquarters of the African Development Bank in Abidjan from 2 to 7 November , which had reflected the complexity of the problem and the cooperation between United Nations agencies .
UNESCO had also organized an interdisciplinary think-tank on education for democracy at Tunis from 8 to 10 November 1992 .
In conclusion UNESCO was trying to focus action , to assign priorities and to address target groups , such as young people and women , so that interdisciplinary action could be taken on any cultural or human problem .
38 . Mr. NENEMAN observed that there had been little or no reporting by Governments on article 15 ; that indicated the existence of a need to develop a better understanding of the article .
The Committee had to elaborate a set of questions and guidelines so as to induce more appropriate reporting .
Mr. Konate had taken an important step in that direction , but the issue was complex and could not be resolved quickly .
The ideas expressed by Ms. Hausermann , especially the four principles of accessibility , participation , artistic freedom and influence on policy making , might form the core of the Committee &apos;s future guidelines .
39 . Focus was needed on the right to culture in countries in the process of transition .
In his own country , Poland , unquestionable progress had been made in respect of freedom of expression ; for the time being it did not seem to be in danger , although there had been an attempt by the Church to suppress some plays or songs that were critical of it .
The most difficult problems at present lay in the access to culture .
Ms. Hausermann had mentioned the decline in government subsidies .
Poland had had about 100 professional theatres and a number of acting schools .
In the past , almost every graduate of such a school had been assigned to a theatre and had received a monthly salary .
Today , actors had to market their talents , and the best actors marketed their talent for better money in Germany or France , with a resulting talent-drain , as it were .
Perhaps that simply underlined the unity of European culture and provided new openings for talented people .
At the same time , the number of theatres had declined : performances of plays directly in front of the public , for example in factories , had been discontinued .
Price reductions for small groups had disappeared .
It had been fashionable to go to the theatre and to concerts ; that had disappeared , as was inevitable in a market economy .
New ways of maintaining accessibility to culture had to be found , and what was true in Poland was also largely true in other countries in the throes of transition .
In Poland there had been about 30 subsidized philharmonic orchestras .
Now only a few had subsidies ; the rest were doomed to extinction .
Fortunately , musicians who had freedom of movement could sell their talent in other countries .
40 . As for books , although in the past books had not been expensive and world classics were freely available in translation , censorship had meant that some important modern works were unobtainable .
At present access to books was unrestricted , but they were now a market commodity and bookshops , which now had to make a profit to survive , were principally stocking ephemeral literature of mass appeal rather than literature of quality .
The most drastic cultural impact of the recent changes had been on the film industry .
In the past only the best foreign films had been imported ; at present only films that made money for the cinemas , generally second-rate films of mass appeal , were being shown and national films were being squeezed out of the market place .
41 . It was important to ask questions as to the best way to defend quality in culture , which had been an unfortunate casualty of the free market system , not merely of the decline in subsidies .
The problem was not so much the institution of a welcome free market , but the fact that the countries in transition had abandoned their old systems but did not yet have the kind of infrastructure of support for the arts that existed in the West .
Attention therefore needed to be focused on such situations and new guidelines and questions developed to cope with it .
42 . Mrs. JIMÉNEZ-BUTRAGEÑO , welcoming Mr. Konate &apos;s paper , said that the distinction he had made between the right to take part in cultural life as an individual and the collective right to enjoy cultural assets had also featured in her list of questions .
She looked forward to receiving the conclusions and recommendations he proposed appending to his report , as they would be most useful for the further work of the Committee .
43 . A revision of the guidelines was imperative to remedy the failure of many countries to provide information on cultural rights , or to overlook minorities because the Covenant did not mention them specifically .
44 . Since the particular vulnerable and disadvantaged group with which she was concerned was the elderly , she hoped that the congress Ms. Hausermann was to attend would pay some attention to the concerns of the elderly , whose numbers and needs in Europe were growing .
She had been grateful for documentary assistance received from UNESCO in the preparation of her paper on the elderly .
With increasing life expectancy , there was increasing opportunity for the elderly to take an interest in society and to contribute to it .
It would be interesting to know what ideas UNESCO had on ways to enable the elderly to participate in education and culture .
Many of the elderly sought access to study at all levels , not merely to overcome illiteracy but also to enter university .
As an example , a 93 year-old woman was at present studying medicine at the University of Santiago de Compostella .
The elderly were also disadvantaged in the world of books , where they often found costs prohibitive particularly as the larger print books many needed were not available in inexpensive paperback editions .
45 . She expressed appreciation of the comments made by other Committee members , in particular Mr. Wimer Zembrano , who had rightly stressed the need for the Committee to consider practical matters in addition to theoretical , philosophical and legal points .
46 . Mr. TEXIER commended Mr. Konate on his excellent introductory paper .
There was a clear need for reflection on an issue of such complexity as cultural rights , especially as article 15 embraced a vast arena not only of cultural rights and cultural life but also scientific research and its applications - an area which had so far received little attention from the Committee .
47 . In determining the areas to which States should give greatest attention in their reports and to which the Committee &apos;s recommendations should be directed , four major aspects would need to be considered .
The first was that there should be no discrimination between cultures since no hierarchy of cultures existed , all were equal and therefore had an equal right to protection .
Discrimination against and destruction of cultures had been constant factors in world history , not merely in the colonial era , and were still continuing throughout the world .
There were many examples in a changing Europe , and another instance was provided by Guatemala where despite the fact that 60 per cent of the population were indigenous Indians their culture was repressed and neglected to the extent that such expressions of it as clothing and diet were actively discouraged .
The protection accorded all cultures should include language .
Many languages , in Europe and elsewhere , were disappearing for lack of support from central authorities .
48 . Access to culture by all was a second major point . Such access was often a question of economics .
Support of cultural rights was in some countries a luxury that had to yield place to meeting other more fundamental rights , such as those considered in article 11 of the Covenant .
In that area the questions to States should be directed to what they were doing to allow access to culture by the greatest number .
49 . A third important point was the growing uniformization of culture or the lowering of the level of culture to the lowest common denominator , generally the invasion of a cultural model from outside shaped by purely economic factors and market forces , whose productions were cheap and readily accessible .
Questions would need to be found to clarify that situation in relation to the need to protect all cultures and ensure the survival of those economically unable to compete .
50 . The fourth important area was the right to freedom of scientific research .
Questions to States had to date been limited to asking whether that freedom and intellectual property rights were being protected .
Questions should also be asked on how to prevent the freedom to engage in scientific research from leading to ecological disasters or how to resolve the ethical problems posed by certain scientific advances , for example in the field of human reproduction .
51 . Mr. FOFANA commended Mr. Konate on his exemplary paper .
52 . It was generally agreed that the protection of cultural rights was a central pillar of human rights and as such crucial to development , which represented the fulfilment of the spirit of the individual and of the community and the renewal of civil and political as well as economic , cultural and social rights .
In practice , however , the protection of cultural rights could clash with economic and social development .
For example , Mount Nimba in south-east Guinea had rich mineral deposits whose extraction was essential for the economic well-being of the country .
The area was also host to a unique species of giant viviparous frog that had been declared a world heritage species , whose survival was imperative in terms of global culture .
Guinea was thus faced with the problem of reconciling two conflicting interests .
The Committee should perhaps give some time to considering how best to tackle such problems .
53 . Mr. KOUZNETSOV joined in the appreciation expressed by other speakers for Mr. Konate &apos;s paper .
54 . As many members of the Committee had remarked in their comments on article 15 , the wording of the two Covenants differed on a number of points .
In particular , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was more stringent in imposing obligations on States than article 15 of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights which merely advised States to recognize rights .
The Committee was not competent to amend the wording of the Covenant but it could interpret its &quot; soft &quot; provisions in an authoritative and prestigious way to give them more force by stressing the rights of individuals and the obligation of States to uphold those rights .
The Committee should then endeavour to spell out the specific obligations incumbent on States in the cultural field , for example on the question of subsidies .
In its reports , the Committee should also try to draw conclusions on what progress if any had been achieved .
Perhaps Mr. Konate could , on the basis of the questions Committee members had asked with respect to article 15 of the Covenant , draft wording setting out the obligations of States on cultural rights .
Although it would of course not be possible to apply requirements across the board , States could be required to provide legislative , administrative and financial measures to guarantee the promotion of cultural rights .
55 . He drew attention to an editorial correction to be made to Mr. Konate &apos;s paper .
Chernobyl , which had been mentioned in the context of ecological disasters , was not located in the Russian Federation and it should be mentioned as being either in the former Soviet Union or in the Ukraine .
The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.

GE.92-18823 ( E )
The meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.
RELATIONS WITH UNITED NATIONS ORGANS AND OTHER TREATY BODIES ( agenda item 8 )
1 . The CHAIRMAN welcomed Mr. Sachar , a member of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , who had prepared a comprehensive and useful working paper on the right to adequate housing ( E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 15 ) .
2 . Mr. SACHAR said that he had been greatly encouraged in his work by the General Comment No. 4 which the Committee had adopted in 1991 .
He had referred to that Comment in paragraph 7 of his paper and had noted that the Committee was of the view that the right to housing should not be interpreted in a narrow or restrictive sense .
More important still , the Committee had gone on to stress that the right to adequate housing could be viewed in isolation from other human rights contained in the two International Covenants and other applicable international instruments .
That point needed stressing because a debate seemed to be under way about which of the two Covenants was more important .
He had always maintained that it was a futile controversy to try to choose between bread and freedom , which were two sides of the same coin .
There was a danger that society would be torn apart if adequate housing was not provided for the millions of people who were homeless , and he was glad that the Committee was addressing the topic in greater depth and detail and with greater emphasis .
He hoped it would become a key issue in the future , since he was worried about the tendency to make economic , social and cultural rights a matter of good intentions without giving Governments a mandate or instructions .
3 . In India , the right to adequate housing had been developed in the famous Bombay City case , where hundreds of thousands of pavement dwellers had been removed to a place 20 or 30 km distant and provided with land .
However , the permanent dwellers had gone to court , and the court had interpreted the right to life which was guaranteed under the Indian Constitution as the right to live with dignity , which was impossible without a house and a livelihood .
The court had found that merely providing housing without regard to livelihood by taking the pavement dwellers away from their normal place of work was a denial of their rights .
It was not enough to provide shelter ; that shelter had to be connected with the right to earn a living and with other rights .
4 . He expressed his appreciation of the Committee &apos;s work and hoped to have its guidance in the future .
5 . The CHAIRMAN said that he looked forward to continuing contacts with Mr. Sachar and hoped the Committee would be able to exchange ideas with him .
In particular he thanked Mr. Sachar for his reference to the Bombay City case in the light of continued scepticism about the possibilities of making economic , social and cultural rights justiciable .
In his view those who raised the issue of justiciability were more concerned to prevent economic rights from assuming the status they deserved than to make complex legal points .
FORMULATION OF SUGGESTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF A GENERAL NATURE BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS SUBMITTED BY STATES PARTIES TO THE COVENANT AND BY THE SPECIALIZED AGENCIES ( agenda item 9 ) ( E / C.12 / 1992 / WP.15 ) .
6 . The CHAIRMAN noted that earlier in the session there had been a lack of clarity regarding follow-up actions and that as a result some of the exchanges with States parties had not been very rewarding .
Mr. Simma had kindly prepared a note on the subject ( E / C.12 / 1992 / WP.15 ) .
Since the note was available only in English , he invited Mr. Simma to read it out so that it could be interpreted into the other working languages and then to introduce it .
7 . Mr. SIMMA , after reading out his note explained that , of the four paragraphs , paragraphs 1 and 2 were introductory and paragraph 3 listed the options open to the Committee .
Paragraph 4 was concerned with situations in which the Committee considered that it was unable to obtain information through the channels indicated in paragraph 3 and represented an attempt to codify the action already taken by the Committee in the case of the Dominican Republic and Panama .
The note might appear to be too broad , but in view of the procedural problems with which the Committee had been confronted the situation needed clarification .
8 . Mr. WIMER ZAMBRANO said that the procedure involved was of a delicate nature .
He wondered what name should be given to the persons acting on behalf of the Committee .
9 . The CHAIRMAN noted that the term used in Mr. Simma &apos;s note was &quot; Committee representative ( s ) &quot; .
To use &quot; country rapporteur &quot; would lead to confusion .
10 . Mr. SIMMA said that &quot; Committee representative ( s ) &quot; was the designation which he had in mind .
It was neutral enough to allow for various functions and was different from the nomenclature employed by the Commission on Human Rights .
He therefore suggested that it should be used as the official term .
11 . It was so agreed .
12 . Mr. WIMER ZAMBRANO pointed out that the mission itself also needed to be given a name .
13 . The CHAIRMAN observed that in paragraph 4 the term &quot; on-site visit &quot; was used .
That seemed to be a good description .
14 . Mr. SIMMA remarked that &quot; on-site &quot; sounded too much like a disarmament operation .
The term &quot; visit by representatives of the Committee &quot; was unlikely to upset States parties &apos; sensitivities .
15 . Mr. MRATCHKOV said that the most important paragraph in the well-prepared note was paragraph 4 .
The two cases which the Committee had come across so far - the Dominican Republic and Panama - had been rather different .
The mission sent pursuant to the decision taken at the Committee &apos;s sixth session and endorsed by the Economic and Social Council had been an advisory mission , whereas the text of paragraph 4 was more concerned with establishing direct contact for the purpose of obtaining further information on the situation within the country concerned .
Advising a Government through the provision of technical assistance by the Committee and the collection of information were not the same thing .
16 . The CHAIRMAN suggested that an additional paragraph was needed .
Paragraph 4 was essentially concerned with ascertaining the facts .
The Committee representatives could first , on the basis of their observations , make recommendations to the Committee , which could then , if appropriate , offer advice to the Government in question .
The decision taken by the Economic and Social Council in 1991 had omitted the first phase , which was rightly included in Mr. Simma &apos;s note .
17 . Mr. SIMMA agreed that paragraph 4 of the note dealt with the situation in which the Committee had been unable to obtain the necessary information to conclude its dialogue with the State party , although there was a reference to the advisory services programme in the last sentence .
In the light of Mr. Mratchkov &apos;s comment it might be advisable to add a paragraph 5 or a subparagraph ( b ) , making paragraph 4 subparagraph ( a ) .
The new paragraph or subparagraph could codify procedures followed the previous year with regard to the Dominican Republic , where the situation had been different , since the Government had not refuted the factual information before the Committee , whereas Panama had expressly done so .
18 . Mr. WIMER ZAMBRANO also agreed with Mr. Mratchkov but was not in favour of having two paragraphs instead of one .
Many different situations might arise ; the case of Panama involved not only a different interpretation of the facts but two different versions of them : the assertion that the information the Committee possessed did not coincide with the facts of the situation as described by the representative of Panama .
Instead of being divided , elements should be added to the paragraph in order to provide for flexibility in carrying out the visit ; it was not just a question of making contact with the Government but of gleaning in situ information that had been denied to the Committee .
19 . Mr. TEXIER supported Mr. Wimer Zambrano &apos;s proposal : the mandate given to visiting experts should be relatively general .
Contacts with the State were important but it was also important to have contacts with society at large .
It was important to have several sources of information ; in the case of the Dominican Republic and also of Panama , much information had come from non-governmental sources .
Since such missions would be few in number their mandate should be as broad as possible .
20 . Mr. SIMMA , agreeing with previous speakers , said that he was prepared to redraft the paragraph and would take account of their observations .
21 . Mr. MUTERAHEJURU asked for clarifications about the conditions that had to be fulfilled before the Committee deemed it necessary to send representatives to visit a country .
Mr. Simma might indeed have credible sources of information , but was it the case that each time a State party denied the validity of information furnished by members of the Committee which called that State party into question , the Committee would be justified in making an on-site visit ?
22 . The CHAIRMAN pointed out that the procedure in question was not one that the Committee could impose on a State party .
It consisted of a request to the State party to invite a representative of the Committee , and it remained entirely at the discretion of the Government whether or not to accept such a mission .
The Committee had to be satisfied that there was cause for grave concern and would need to have exhausted other means of obtaining the relevant information .
Those conditions had been fulfilled in the case of Panama .
As Mr. Texier had said , the procedure was not one which the Committee would wish to use very often , but in his view it was an option that should be kept open .
23 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO , congratulating Mr. Simma on the presentation of his paper , said that she did not think it advisable to stress in paragraph 4 that the Committee &apos;s visits should not be considered analogous to the appointment of a special rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights .
It would be better to refrain from making any reference to a special rapporteur .
24 . Mr. MARCHAN ROMERO , agreeing with Mrs. Jimenez Butragueño , said that it would be inadvisable to make specific reference to a special rapporteur since a reader would immediately ask what was the special rapporteur &apos;s role .
Analogies or dissimilarities with other human rights bodies should not be pointed out unless strictly necessary , which was not the case in paragraph 4 .
25 . Mr. KONATE , thanking Mr. Simma for his note , observed that it was not clear to him from paragraph 3 at what moment the Committee had to choose from among the various options that were mentioned .
With regard to paragraph 4 , the idea of an on-site visit should aim at two objectives , and the idea of advisory services should be given preference in order to make the mission more acceptable .
If the visit , by means of its advisory services , helped a Government to overcome obstacles and proposed solutions , Governments would be much more inclined to accept the visit .
On the other hand if the mission had as its sole object to make a report to the Committee , States parties might see it as a form of censure .
He therefore counselled prudence and pragmatism , given that the Committee &apos;s objective was not only to collect information about the country but to proceed , together with the Government , to evaluate the situation and to make recommendations not only for the measures the Government should take but for measures involving international cooperation .
To decribe the mission as one of evaluation would greatly help the Committee &apos;s action .
26 . Mr. MRATCHKOV said it was apparent that there was a wide variety of sensitive circumstances that might precipitate recourse to the procedure described in paragraph 4 .
It might be useful for the Committee to look beyond the practices followed by the United Nations human rights monitoring bodies , such as the appointment of special rapporteurs , and look to other agencies for guidance .
The International Labour Organisation , for example , had been engaged in a process of direct contacts with Governments for over 30 years , organizing country visits not so much of inspection as of technical assistance .
The initial contacts were made on an unofficial basis by the Secretariat of the Organisation , the International Labour Office , following which the visit procedure proper was formally initiated by the State concerned in the form of an official invitation from its Government to the ILO .
In the case of the Committee , such preliminary background work might be accomplished through the intermediary of the Centre for Human Rights , following which the Committee might designate one or two of its members , together with a representative of the Secretariat , to visit the State concerned , principally with a view to assisting it .
A decision to send a mission to a country that emanated directly from the Economic and Social Council or the Committee , would , even if it were subject to that country &apos;s acceptance , place its Government in a difficult position .
Non-acceptance would imply a failure to implement the Covenant , but acceptance might be an equally sensitive issue .
It would be wise to allow more time for reflection to refine the procedure to be adopted by the Committee .
27 . Mr. WIMER ZAMBRANO agreed that the procedure was one that required careful handling ; the lengthy discussion of the subject was proof that all were aware of its extreme sensitivity .
However , in the case of Panama , its Government &apos;s reply to the Committee had been not merely unsatisfactory and inappropriate but aggressive ; by denouncing the information provided by non-governmental organizations it had impugned the Committee &apos;s proceedings .
In such circumstances , he failed to see how a mission to a country could be restricted to the provision of technical assistance , or how fruitful and productive discussion could be achieved against a background involving the reported destruction of a community .
He joined Mr. Texier in considering that while the Committee had to be very careful with regard to the procedures employed , the mission representing the Committee could not merely be one of dialogue with and support for a Government but would have to determine the real facts behind disquieting reports received by the Committee .
28 . The CHAIRMAN said it would be more appropriate for the Committee to defer the discussion of specific cases , such as that of Panama , until the general principle had been decided .
While appreciating the comments calling attention to the need for the Committee to provide technical assistance and advisory services , action incumbent on it under articles 22 and 23 of the Covenant , he considered , like Mr. Wimer Zambrano and Mr. Texier , that the Committee ought in addition to have the option of a flexible and appropriate response to circumstances .
The Committee would further consider the matter at a later meeting , when a revised version of Mr. Simma &apos;s note , taking the present discussion into account , would be available .
ORGANIZATION OF WORK ( agenda item 2 ) ( continued )
29 . The CHAIRMAN said that in the context of the work still to be done , the Committee would have to consider the case of the New Zealand Government which had indicated its inability to present its report to the present session a mere few days before its commencement , and which having initially indicated a willingness to come before the Committee in May 1993 , currently preferred the November 1993 session for the presentation of its report .
He suggested that when the Committee considered the timetable for presentation of reports , the report of New Zealand should be rescheduled for consideration at the May 1993 session , on the understanding that if the New Zealand Government was again unable to attend , a formal decision should be taken at that session to reschedule consideration of the report in November 1993 .
On the principle that the Committee had to take a firm stand and indicate to Governments that regular deferrals were not an easy option , the Committee would then have the opportunity to apply its decision that on the third occasion when a report was scheduled for consideration it would proceed whether or not the State party was able to be present .
30 . It was so decided .
31 . The CHAIRMAN said that the Committee had already decided in principle that the next day of general discussion would focus on the rights of the elderly and the ageing as they related to the Covenant .
He proposed that the Committee should adopt that decision formally .
Furthermore , it would appear to be time for the Committee to take the planning of its days of general discussion more seriously in future .
He therefore proposed that , in view of her enthusiasm for the subject , the Committee should invite Mrs. Jiménez Butragueño to undertake the planning of the next day .
It would be understood that that would involve consultation with the Secretariat and access to its advice and assistance in contacting all relevant United Nations agencies both in Geneva and elsewhere for contributions in the form of sending representatives , identifying particular topics or providing already existing or specially written documentation .
Individual experts and groups might also be asked to attend or to submit short written comments in advance .
Arrangements would also be made to circulate the relevant documents to members of the Committee in the relevant languages .
32 . It was so decided .
The meeting rose at 12 noon .

The meeting was called to order at 10.35 a.m.
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL ( agenda item 10 ) E / C.12 / 1992 / CRP.1 and Add.1-4 ; E / C.12 / 1992 / WP.14 and 19 ) .
E / C.12 / 1992 / CRP.1
1 . The CHAIRMAN said that he would not go through the document paragraph by paragraph .
Amendments would be made to paragraph 15 concerning two other reports by New Zealand .
2 . Mr. SIMMA observed that in paragraph 15 mention was made of Germany under the second heading which read &quot; concerning articles 1 to 15 &quot; whereas it belonged under the third heading concerning articles 13 to 15 .
3 . The CHAIRMAN explained that a number of minor corrections would be made to the document : the heading mentioned by Mr. Simma should read &quot; articles 13 to 15 &quot; and the following heading should read &quot; articles 1 to 15 &quot; because those reports were comprehensive .
In addition , Mexico would be deleted from the list of countries in the paragraph and four countries , Belgium , Kenya , Lebanon and Surinam , would be included for consideration in the absence of any report .
4 . Mr. NENEMAN said that a change was also needed in paragraph 4 , which stated that Mr. Alvarez Vita had attended part of the session .
5 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO pointed out that in the Spanish text the first paragraph stated that only 18 States had ratified or acceded to the Covenant as at 11 December 1992 .
6 . The CHAIRMAN said that the Spanish text should read 118 , as did the English text .
7 . Mr. SPARSIS called attention to paragraph 5 of the document which read &quot; The following specialized agencies were represented by observers : ILO , UNESCO and WHO &quot; .
In fact only WHO had been represented .
8 . Ms. PINET ( World Health Organization ) said that it was important that the specialized agencies should have more time to devote to cooperation with United Nations human rights bodies .
9 . The CHAIRMAN agreed ; the problem was how to bring that about .
The Committee could decide in future to specify the number of meetings attended by each agency .
10 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO said that since WHO was the only specialized agency that had really been represented , it should at least be listed first and not last in the report .
11 . The CHAIRMAN said that it would look strange not to use alphabetical order without offering any explanation of the reason for doing so .
Alternatively , a sentence could be drafted in the report saying that , with the exception of WHO , the attendance of representatives of specialized agencies was sporadic at best , and that the Committee regretted that situation because it considered the involvement of the specialized agencies in its work to be of major importance .
That observation would not appear in document E / C.12 / 1992 / CRP.1 but later on , in the review of the Committee &apos;s work .
He would submit a draft comment at the appropriate time .
12 . Document E / C.12 / 1992 / CRP.1 , as amended , was adopted .
E / C.12 / 1992 / CRP.1 / Add.1
Paragraphs 1-7
13 . Paragraphs 1-7 were adopted .
Paragraph 8
14 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO said that since she had a special interest in the elderly she felt that the word corresponding to &quot; adults &quot; in the Spanish text was not sufficient and that the Spanish text should contain a reference to ancianos or old people in particular .
15 . The CHAIRMAN suggested the text formulation &quot; adults , including the elderly &quot; .
16 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO and Mr. MRATCHKOV endorsed the Chairman &apos;s suggestion .
17 . Paragraph 8 , as amended , was adopted .
Paragraph 9
18 . Mr. SPARSIS pointed out that for the sake of consistency the word &quot; establishments &quot; in the second line of paragraph 9 should be replaced by the word &quot; institutions &quot; .
19 . Mr. KOUZNETSOV said that the word in the Russian text corresponding to the word &quot; maintenance &quot; in the second sentence in paragraph 9 was not very satisfactory and that the translation would have to be made more specific .
His remarks referred only to the Russian text .
20 . Paragraph 9 , as amended , was adopted .
Paragraph 10
21 . Mr. SIMMA said that when drafting the concluding observations on Belarus he had included a reference to the introduction of fees for tenth and eleventh grade education .
He suggested that the statement in question should be included in the paragraph .
22 . Mr. KOUZNETSOV recalled that the representative of Belarus had said that the Government intended to introduce fees for higher study and that it was not an accomplished fact .
23 . Mr. SIMMA said that Mr. Kouznetsov was correct .
The relevant passage in the concluding observations read &quot; the Committee notes with particular concern the intention of the Government of Belarus to introduce fees for education in the tenth and eleventh grades &quot; .
He suggested the insertion after the words &quot; expenditure on education &quot; of the sentence &quot; They therefore had the intention to introduce fees for education in the tenth and eleventh grades . &quot; .
24 . Paragraph 10 , as amended , was adopted .
Paragraph 11
25 . Mr. SPARSIS proposed that in the penultimate line of the paragraph the term &quot; equivalent employee &quot; should be amended to read &quot; comparable employee &quot; .
26 . Paragraph 11 , as amended , was adopted .
Paragraphs 12-18
27 . Paragraphs 12-18 were adopted .
28 . Document E / C.12 / 1992 / CRP.1 / Add.1 , as amended , was adopted .
29 . The CHAIRMAN noted that the text of the concluding observations on Belarus which had been adopted at an earlier meeting by the Committee would be included in the final report .
E / C.12 / 1992 / CRP.1 / Add.2
Paragraph 1
30 . The CHAIRMAN said that a reference to 4 December 1992 would be added to paragraph 1 .
31 . Paragraph 1 , as amended , was adopted .
Paragraphs 2-4
32 . Paragraphs 2-4 were adopted .
Paragraph 5
33 . Mr. SIMMA pointed out that the last sentence of the paragraph stated that the Polish Charter of Rights and Freedoms provided that all citizens &quot; could seize any of the international human rights bodies established under treaties &quot; , whereas many human rights bodies could not be seized by individuals .
34 . The CHAIRMAN suggested that the phrase should be amended to read : &quot; could , where appropriate , submit communications to relevant human rights bodies &quot; .
35 . Paragraph 5 , as amended , was adopted .
Paragraphs 6-8
36 . Paragraphs 6-8 were adopted .
37 . Mrs. BONOAN-DANDAN pointed out that since the Polish delegation had included one woman , who had given some of the replies , in paragraph 9 and elsewhere , as appropriate , the pronoun &quot; his &quot; should be deleted .
38 . Mr. SPARSIS asked whether there was a difference between the word &quot; bill &quot; used in paragraph 9 and the word &quot; act &quot; used in paragraph 11 .
39 . The CHAIRMAN said that once a bill was adopted it became an act ; therefore the word &quot; bill &quot; in the second line of paragraph 9 should be amended to read &quot; act &quot; .
40 . Paragraph 9 , as amended , was adopted .
Paragraphs 10-17
41 . Paragraphs 10-17 were adopted .
Paragraph 18
42 . Mrs. BONOAN-DANDAN said that , to make the ultimate destination of participants in the brain drain clear , the word &quot; there &quot; should be added after &quot; stay &quot; .
43 . Paragraph 18 , as amended , was adopted .
44 . The CHAIRMAN noted that the text of the concluding observations had been adopted by the Committee at an earlier meeting and would be included in the final report .
45 . Document E / C.12 / 1992 / CRP.1 / Add.2 , as amended , was adopted .
E / C.12 / 1992 / CRP.1 / Add.3
Paragraphs 1-2
46 . Paragraphs 1-2 were adopted .
Paragraph 3
47 . Mr. SPARSIS said that , to be consistent with the wording in earlier parts of the report , the word &quot; establishment &quot; should be replaced by &quot; institution &quot; , an editorial correction that ought also to be applied throughout the report in references to education .
48 . It was so decided .
49 . Paragraph 3 , as amended , was adopted .
Paragraphs 4-9
50 . Paragraphs 4-9 were adopted .
51 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO said that although the word &quot; gender &quot; was correct English usage it should be rendered by sexo in Spanish .
52 . Paragraph 10 , as amended , was adopted .
Paragraphs 11-16
53 . Paragraphs 1-16 , as amended , were adopted .
Paragraph 17
54 . Mr. SPARSIS suggested that the words &quot; other forms of &quot; should be deleted from the fifth sentence .
55 . Paragraph 17 , as amended , was adopted .
56 . Mr. SIMMA proposed that the words &quot; countries other than those of the European Community &quot; in the last sentence should be replaced by &quot; non-European countries &quot; .
57 . Paragraph 18 , as amended , was adopted .
Paragraphs 19-23
58 . Paragraphs 19-23 were adopted .
Paragraphs 24-28
59 . The CHAIRMAN noted that paragraphs 24-28 contained the concluding observations of the Committee , the text of which had been adopted at an earlier meeting .
60 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO proposed that the words &quot; did not meet the guidelines &quot; should be replaced by &quot; were at variance with the guidelines &quot; .
61 . It was so agreed .
62 . Document E / C.12 / 1992 / CRP.1 / Add.3 , as amended , was adopted .
E / C.12 / 1992 / CRP.1 / Add.4
Paragraphs 1-3
63 . Paragraphs 1-3 were adopted .
Paragraph 4
64 . Mr. FOFANA said that in the French text tribunal constitutionnel should be replaced by conseil constitutionnel , since that was the term for the institution generally used in French-speaking countries .
65 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO said that , as in other Spanish-speaking countries , the term in use in her country for the body issuing rulings on the conformity of laws with the Constitution was the Tribunal constitucional .
The text therefore ought not to be amended in Spanish .
66 . Mr. WIMER ZAMBRANO said that since &quot; council &quot; was the expression used to describe the institution concerned in most countries throughout the world it would be preferable .
67 . Mr. MRATCHKOV said the problem was not one of language but of function .
A council operated in a different manner to a court or tribunal .
In the French text , either cours or tribunal would be acceptable ; it was important , however , that whichever term was used should be consistent with the general usage elsewhere in the Committee &apos;s texts .
68 . The CHAIRMAN said that the term appearing in the text ought to refer to the institution in place in the country concerned .
Since the Hungarian delegation had used the English term &quot; Constitutional Court &quot; he suggested that it should remain as such in the English text with appropriate renderings in the other languages .
69 . Mr. MUTERAHEJURU endorsed that opinion .
70 . Paragraph 4 , as amended , was adopted .
Paragraphs 5-12
70 . Paragraphs 5-12 were adopted .
Paragraph 13
72 . Mr. SIMMA proposed that the word &quot; additional &quot; should be deleted from the fifth sentence .
73 . The CHAIRMAN , observing that the word &quot; natural &quot; implied that disadvantages were the unavoidable lot of minorities , suggested that the whole phrase should be amended to read &quot; to compensate for disadvantages which usually flow from being a member of a minority group by advantages in terms of &quot; .
74 . Paragraph 13 , as amended , was adopted .
Paragraph 14
75 . Paragraph 14 was adopted .
Paragraph 15
76 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO proposed that the final phrase should be amended to read &quot; to facilitate access to and participation in culture by elderly persons &quot; .
77 . Paragraph 15 , as amended , was adopted .
Paragraph 16
78 . Paragraph 16 was adopted .
79 . Mr. SPARSIS said he was unclear as to the exact meaning of the term &quot; risk participation &quot; .
80 . The CHAIRMAN said he assumed it meant that the researchers themselves shared a part of the risk involved in the project and would thus have a share in the profits .
81 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO proposed the term be replaced by &quot; joint participation &quot; which would imply both risks and profits .
82 . Mrs. BONOAN-DANDAN said that possible replacement terms might be &quot; counterpart funding &quot; or &quot; contracts with institutional participation &quot; .
83 . Mr. KONATE said his impression from exchanges with the Hungarian representative was that the purpose of the new research contracts was to ensure the sharing of any profits that might result .
It was important to express the precise meaning intended by the Hungarian delegation .
84 . Mr. SIMMA , endorsing that last opinion , said that the report should use the actual words of the Hungarian representative as recorded in the summary record of the meeting concerned .
85 . The CHAIRMAN said that since the relevant record ( E / C.12 / 1992 / SR.9 , para . 7 ) he made reference only to risk participation without any mention of profits , he would suggest that the term &quot; risk participation &quot; should be retained but placed in inverted commas .
86 . It was so decided .
87 . Mr. SPARSIS said the penultimate sentence was unclear .
88 . The CHAIRMAN said it would be within the Committee &apos;s competence to amend the text to clarify the meaning of the Hungarian representative &apos;s statement .
89 . Mr. NENEMAN said that would best be achieved by amending the last part of the sentence to read simply &quot; the brain drain would involve not only disadvantages but also advantages for Hungary &quot; .
90 . Paragraph 17 , as amended , was adopted .
91 . Document E / C.12 / 1992 / CRP.1 / Add.4 , as amended , was adopted .
E / C.12 / 1992 / WP.19
92 . The CHAIRMAN noted that the headings used for the five sections of the working paper followed the format employed by the Human Rights Committee , the Committee on the Rights of the Child and , to a large degree , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination .
93 . Mr. MARCHAN ROMERO said that it was the first time that he had seen that format , and he was in favour of adopting it .
He noted that it had not been used in the case of Norway . The Committee should be consistent in the layout of its reports .
94 . Mr. SIMMA said that as the format used for Hungary was different , the Committee should submit the concluding observations without the headings , while retaining the substance , so that the difference would not be so striking .
It could then adopt the format with the headings for 1993 .
95 . The CHAIRMAN agreed and thought that that would respond to Mr. Marchan Romero &apos;s concern .
96 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO said that she considered that the Committee should not express its appreciation for the written report .
Instead , it should be more specific in expressing its appreciation for a particular response .
97 . The CHAIRMAN said that that sentence had appeared for three reasons : firstly , it was the standard phrase used by other committees ; secondly , the Committee would be considering situations in which no report had been submitted at all ; and thirdly , the Committee was expressing appreciation for the written report , not just taking note of the fact that it had been presented .
There would be other occasions in the future when the Committee would criticize a report .
98 . Paragraph 1 was adopted .
Paragraph 2
99 . Mr. SIMMA said that the working paper had been prepared on the basis of the French text , and that the translation of the words &quot; Ecole supérieure d &apos;administration &quot; in paragraph 2 had subsequently been made available : &quot; National School of Administration &quot; .
100 . Mr. SPARSIS wondered whether the words &quot; the special education programmes put in place &quot; should not be replaced by &quot; the special education programmes implemented &quot; .
101 . Mr. SIMMA said that there had been a reason for saying &quot; put in place &quot; : it was not yet known how such programmes worked in practice .
102 . Paragraph 2 was adopted .
Paragraphs 3-4
103 . Paragraphs 3-4 were adopted .
104 . Mrs. BONOAN-DANDAN said that paragraph 5 had no heading , and as it dealt with principal subjects of concern , i.e. the subject of paragraph 4 , it should be included in that paragraph , and the reference to paragraph 5 should be deleted .
105 . Mr. MARCHAN ROMERO objected to the reference to educational rights , which introduced a new category .
Clearly , educational rights were included in cultural rights .
He therefore proposed deleting the words &quot; educational and &quot; .
106 . The CHAIRMAN said that that was a difficult issue .
It was often assumed that the Covenant could be divided into a section on economic rights ( arts . 6 to 9 ) , social rights ( arts . 10 to 12 ) and cultural rights ( arts . 13 to 15 ) . Such a division was questionable .
In his view , education was very much an economic right in the sense that it was costly to implement and it was vital to the economic well-being of the individual .
It was a social right in that one could not participate fully in society without it .
The reason for using the term &quot; education &quot; was simply to refer to articles 13 and 14 of the Covenant .
He noted that UNESCO also spoke of educational rights .
107 . Mr. SIMMA proposed the following wording for the phrase in question : &quot; the need to ensure that special attention is paid to the right to education and culture of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of Hungarian society &quot; .
That would take Mr. Marchan Romero &apos;s comment into account .
108 . Paragraph 5 , as amended , was adopted .
109 . Document E / C.12 / 1992 / WP.19 , as amended was adopted .
E / C.12 / 1992 / WP.14
110 . Mr. NENEMAN said that he had doubts about the logical format of the entire text .
In paragraph 4 , it was stated that the Committee &apos;s main concern was the right to housing , a rather sweeping statement .
Clearly , the Committee also focused on other matters .
While that would be easy to correct , the overall imbalance of the working paper created a more serious problem : the text had only eight paragraphs , yet a total of five dealt with housing .
111 . The CHAIRMAN said that it was for the Committee to decide what course it wished to follow , but in his opinion the text was seeking to reflect the fact that the great majority of questions put had related to housing .
He accepted Mr. Nenemans &apos;s point that the first sentence in paragraph 4 needed to be redrafted .
It might read &quot; In the consideration of the report the Committee devoted particular attention to the right to housing &quot; .
112 . Mr. KONATE said that he had the same misgivings as Mr. Neneman .
The Committee should move paragraphs 5 to 8 from its concluding observations to the part reflecting the general discussion .
That would be both more logical and more in conformity with the Committee &apos;s usual procedure .
113 . The CHAIRMAN noted that in the case of Italy &apos;s report there had been a more sustained focus than usual on one particular issue , which had enabled the Committee to enter into greater detail and to draw conclusions .
114 . Mr. SIMMA said that he was in favour of retaining the text as it stood .
Paragraphs 5 to 8 should be kept where they were but should be given a proper introduction .
A phrase such as &quot; The Committee notes with concern that &quot; could be used to provide a compromise solution .
So far the Committee &apos;s shortcoming in dealing with concluding observations had been the lack of specific remarks regarding points which the Committee had not found satisfactory .
The Committee needed to move away from polite comments like &quot; It is gratified by the high level of the delegation &quot; , which should be omitted in future .
In the case under consideration , since the debate with the delegation of Italy , especially the latter part of it , had focused on housing , that should be reflected but in the form of a concern expressed by the Committee .
115 . Mr. TEXIER said that , as the author of the original text , he quite understood Mr. Konate &apos;s point of view .
However , if the discussion with the State party had mainly related to a topic of particular concern to the Committee , that point should be specifically stressed .
He had accordingly mentioned a number of concrete points in the concluding observations .
He ought , perhaps , to have combined the paragraphs in question into a single paragraph .
116 . The CHAIRMAN observed that what Mr. Texier had stated was in line with what all the other treaty bodies were now trying to do .
Mr. Konate was validly concerned about the fact that the Committee was changing its rules as it went along .
The Committee was in fact moving inevitably away from vagueness towards greater specificity .
That change would also be helpful to States parties , which would undoubtedly understand that the Committee &apos;s rules were in a transitional stage and that meanwhile the vulnerable and disadvantaged would be protected .
117 . Mr. NENEMAN said that the case under consideration was different from all the others because Italy &apos;s report was comprehensive and covered all articles of the Covenant . More comprehensive concluding observations were therefore needed .
In the text before the Committee the observations on housing were very well put .
The parts of comprehensive reports dealing with such issues as education and culture were also important .
For example , the defects in the system of secondary education in Italy were probably as important as the housing problems , but in the case of a comprehensive report it might not be possible to cover all issues in a short text .
118 . The CHAIRMAN suggested that the Committee might wish to combine the paragraphs in question into a single paragraph preceded by the words &quot; The Committee notes with concern ... &quot; .
119 . Mr. KONATE stressed that paragraphs 5 to 8 reflected the discussion between the Committee and the delegation of Italy and should be placed in the general descriptive part and not in the concluding observations .
Either a single paragraph reflecting the Committee &apos;s concerns could be placed after paragraph 4 or all the paragraphs in question could be moved to the general descriptive part .
120 . The CHAIRMAN said that he quite understood Mr. Konate &apos;s concern but wondered whether the solution would not be to combine the paragraphs and introduce the new combined paragraph with the words &quot; the Committee wishes to draw the attention of the State party to a number of specific concerns resulting from the dialogue with its representatives .
These concerns included the fact that ... , &quot; followed by the existing text largely as it stood .
That compromise would meet both the desire to reflect the specific issues in the concluding observations and the need not to list them as if they were facts .
121 . Mr. KONATE noted that it was the first time that the Committee was adopting such a procedure . It could presumably be followed in respect of all other reports .
However , in order not to hold up the proceedings , he would not insist on maintaining his position .
122 . The CHAIRMAN thanked Mr. Konate and inquired whether the Committee accepted the compromise solution which he himself had suggested .
123 . It was so agreed .
124 . Paragraph 1 was adopted .
125 . Mr. KONATE said that he would like to know Mr. Texier &apos;s opinion concerning the use of the word &quot; rapide &quot; in the first sentence of the original French text .
&quot; Bref &quot; or &quot; succinct &quot; would perhaps be better .
126 . Mr. TEXIER replied that he had no objection to the use of &quot; bref &quot;
127 . Mrs. BONOAN-DANDAN observed that &quot; brief &quot; was different from &quot; sketchy &quot; .
128 . The CHAIRMAN said that the use of the word &quot; sketchy &quot; in the English text was fine , so the English text required no change .
129 . Mr. SIMMA noted that in the last sentence it was stated that the report &quot; does not even mention article 11 &quot; .
It would be better to say that the report &quot; does not cover at all the rights contained in article 11 &quot; .
130 . Paragraph 2 , as amended , was adopted .
131 . Mr. SPARSIS recalled that he had stated that privatization entailed risks not only for wage-earners but also for the standard of living , social security , education , housing and health and that he had been supported by Mr. Wimer Zambrano and others in that view .
Consequently , the paragraph as formulated at present was not sufficient to reflect the Committee &apos;s concern that privatization might adversely affect all human rights set forth in the Covenant .
132 . The CHAIRMAN suggested that the words &quot; and all other members of society &quot; should be added after the word &quot; wage-earners &quot; .
133 . Mr. SPARSIS said that it was important for the Committee to indicate clearly that privatization was a potential threat to all human rights , some of which he had already enumerated .
134 . Mr. TEXIER suggested a broader formulation reading &quot; However , the policy of privatization and the abolition of the so-called &apos; sliding scale &apos; system entail certain risks for the social protection of large sectors of the population &quot; would meet that point .
135 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO suggested that the paragraph should begin with the words &quot; The Committee notes the substantial efforts being made by the Italian Government ... &quot; .
136 . Mr. MRATCHKOV suggested that it would be better to divide paragraph 3 into two paragraphs , placing the first three sentences in the first of them and making a new separate paragraph for the last sentence , thereby enhancing its importance .
137 . Paragraph 3 , as amended , was adopted .
138 . The CHAIRMAN recalled the amendment which he had proposed in response to Mr. Neneman &apos;s general comment on the concluding observations .
If there was no objection , he would take it that his amendment was acceptable .
139 . It was so agreed .
140 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO said that she would prefer to use the word &quot; inquilino &quot; instead of &quot; arrendatario &quot; in the Spanish text .
141 . Paragraph 4 , as amended , was adopted .
142 . Mr. SIMMA asked what was meant by &quot; their increase &quot; in the last line .
143 . The CHAIRMAN suggested that the word &quot; their &quot; be replaced by the word &quot; rental &quot; , which was what was meant .
144 . Paragraph 5 , as amended , was adopted .
145 . Paragraphs 6-8 were adopted .
146 . Mr. MARCHAN ROMERO said that he would prefer to omit the reference to the importance which the Committee attached to the right to housing , since it was self-evident .
It would be more appropriate for the Committee to reiterate the importance which it attached to the right to housing .
147 . Mr. WIMER ZAMBRANO agreed with the previous speaker .
148 . Mr. MRATCHKOV also agreed with Mr. Marchan Romero .
He suggested that the words &quot; The Committee wishes to point out the importance which the Covenant attaches to the right to housing and recommends that ... &quot; should be used .
149 . Paragraph 9 , as amended , was adopted .
150 . Document E / C.12 / 1992 / WP.14 , as amended , was adopted .

The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
ORGANIZATION OF WORK ( agenda item 2 ) ( continued )
1 . The CHAIRMAN suggested that the present composition of the working group should be maintained for the current session .
Its members would accordingly be Mrs. Bonoan-Dandan , Mr. Kouznetzov , Mr. Muterahejuru , Mr. Simma and Mr. Wimer Zambrano .
The working group could meet to consider lists of questions the following Monday , 30 November , and any other member of the Committee who wished to participate would be welcome to do so .
2 . It was so decided .
3 . The CHAIRMAN asked whether members agreed to the suggestion made at the 3rd meeting not to produce a report for the May 1993 session but to draft a single report at the November / December 1993 session covering both sessions .
4 . It was so decided .
5 . The CHAIRMAN said that the Committee would thus be able to schedule reports on the situation in non-reporting States parties .
He thought that the most appropriate procedure would be to take two or three States which had been parties to the Covenant for more than 10 years but had never submitted a report .
He suggested selecting the three States that were longest overdue .
They could be informed immediately that their situation was to be considered at the May 1993 session and requested to submit reports or to attend .
6 . Mr. SIMMA pointed out that , in order to have a meaningful discussion , rapporteurs should be appointed for the States concerned .
7 . The CHAIRMAN said that if there was no objection , he would take it that the Committee wished to follow the procedure he had indicated .
8 . It was so decided .
CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS ( agenda item 5 ) ( continued )
( a ) REPORTS SUBMITTED BY STATES PARTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLES 16 AND 17 OF THE COVENANT ( continued )
Norway ( E / 1990 / 7 / Add.7 )
9 . At the invitation of the Chairman , Ms. Lund , Ms. Sirevåg and Mr. Strømmen took places at the Committee table .
10 . Ms. LUND ( Norway ) , expressing her delegation &apos;s appreciation of the Committee &apos;s work , observed that for Norway human rights implied civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights .
That concept was a fundamental part of Norway &apos;s human rights policy .
In 1989 , the Norwegian Government had appointed a committee of lawyers with the mandate to propose how important international human rights treaties to which Norway was a party , including the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural page Rights , might be incorporated into Norwegian legislation .
An amendment to the Constitution had now been proposed for consideration after the new Storting had been elected in 1993 .
11 . Ms. SIREVÅG ( Norway ) , answering questions put by the Committee on articles 13 and 14 of the Covenant , stated that total public expenditure on education in Norway had amounted to 7.2 per cent of the gross national product in 1990 as compared with 7 per cent in 1988 and 6.5 per cent in 1985 .
The Ministry &apos;s proposed budget for education and research in 1993 represented an increase of approximately 6 per cent over that of 1992 .
12 . With regard to pre-school education , she reported that the gap between the actual demand for places and the capacity in existing child-care institutions had been considerably reduced since Norway &apos;s initial report ( E / 1982 / 3 / Add.12 ) had been presented .
Facilities were now provided for 46 per cent of all children between 1 and 7 years of age .
Coverage was low for the youngest children , but increased with age , and at present close to 80 per cent of 6-year-olds were accommodated in child-care institutions .
13 . Replying to the question on the development of vocational training and apprenticeship systems , she explained that in Norway general education and vocational education and training for 16- to 19-year-olds were coordinated in one comprehensive system of upper secondary education , under which vocational education at school was linked with apprenticeship training .
During the 1980s , the upper secondary education system had been considerably expanded , with 75 per cent of the new places in vocational education .
There was a strong focus on the development of apprenticeship training , and measures had been initiated to encourage companies to take on apprentices ; those measures had resulted in a considerable increase in the numbers of apprentices in vocational training and in a growing percentage of young people in the 16 to 19-year age group attending upper secondary school .
Unemployment had meant that more young people were turning to education in the 1990s , but the number of apprenticeship places had declined .
In 1992 , the central Government had taken new initiatives to encourage employers to recruit apprentices .
The State had also continued to give additional grants to the counties , which were responsible for upper secondary education , for extra classes every year .
In addition , the authorities organized vocational courses directed specifically at the labour market .
In January 1991 , around 11,500 young people between 16 and 19 years of age had registered for such courses , as against 3,900 in 1981 .
14 . The figures for 1989 showed that 93.7 per cent of 16-year-olds went on to take upper secondary education .
The present proportion of pupils transferring from lower to upper secondary education was estimated to be about the same .
However , not all pupils in upper secondary education followed the full three years of consecutive education or training .
Many moved horizontally by taking two or three basic foundation courses .
The reform in upper secondary education to be introduced in 1994 was expected to improve that situation .
15 . Turning to new developments , she said that the main aspects of the reforms introduced in 1992 were : the introduction of a legal right to three years &apos; upper secondary education for everyone between the ages of 16 and 19 , with a corresponding obligation on the part of local or regional authorities to provide an adequate number of places ; the introduction of a legal obligation for the local authorities to establish follow-up services for young people who were not in employment , or who had not applied for or accepted a vocational training place , or who chose to terminate their training in the middle of a course , so that as far as possible all young people had the opportunity to acquire an education leading to a recognized qualification ; and the introduction of a new model combining two years at school with subsequent training in the workplace for trades recognized under the Vocational Training Act .
The time spent on the development of the trainee &apos;s skills and the time spent on work for the benefit of the enterprise were clearly distinguished .
The total time from the start of the foundation course to the acquisition of a recognized qualification was up to four years .
The curricula covered the whole period in school and at the workplace .
If there were insufficient apprenticeship places in industry , the local authorities would be responsible for providing equivalent vocational training at school .
16 . Another important aspect was the provision of a broad knowledge base as a point of departure for further specialization and lifelong learning .
Foundation courses would be coordinated and their number reduced from 109 at present to 13 .
Some vocational specialization would take place in the second and especially the third year or in the workplace .
17 . In addition , a general matriculation standard providing entry to all higher education would be introduced , with two minimum requirements : successful completion of three years &apos; consecutive upper secondary education or possession of a recognized vocational qualification / trade certificate ; and a specific level of achievement in Norwegian , English , social studies , mathematics and science / environmental studies .
18 . The reform was scheduled for implementation in the autumn of 1994 .
The main consequence was that places had to be available to all 16-year-olds wishing to enter upper secondary education .
The local authorities also had a duty to provide places for pupils and apprentices in addition to those with the proposed legal right , in order to give opportunities to applicants with special needs for whom three years &apos; education or training was insufficient .
Thus , those with special needs were entitled to take more than three years of education or training if necessary , and also to be given priority in their choice of educational course .
19 . The educational and methodological implications of the reform were considerable , and much effort would be needed to devise suitable teaching methods , for both general studies and vocational training .
The new teachers &apos; guidelines were intended to facilitate separation of the teaching into modules .
A document focusing specifically on the projected reform was available to Committee members .
20 . Turning to the question on the school drop-out rate and unemployment level among young people , she said that it was a principle of Norwegian education that all pupils were offered education adapted to their abilities up to the age of 16 , when compulsory schooling ended .
Special provisions could be made for pupils with special needs .
All pupils took the final examinations , and there was no repeating of grades and consequently no dropping out of compulsory schooling .
However , despite the high numbers that transferred to upper secondary education , progress from one stage to the next was poor at that level , with many pupils moving horizontally .
The Norwegian authorities had recognized that the present system was unsatisfactory and the reform of upper secondary education was expected to correct the situation .
The 16-19 age group was given high priority on the labour market so that unemployment in that group was relatively low .
In September 1992 , around 4,900 young people aged between 16 and 19 years old had been registered as unemployed by the Directorate of Labour .
Most of the unemployment in that group had been among 19-year-olds .
21 . It was difficult to define the respective percentages of boys and girls attending vocational training establishments .
If &quot; vocational &quot; was defined as all education and training other than general studies at upper secondary level , the proportion of girls and boys in vocational education in 1991 was 44.3 per cent and 55.7 per cent respectively .
In comparison the respective proportions of girls and boys in general studies was 55.2 per cent and 44.8 per cent .
There were considerable variations within the different subject areas .
The main conclusion to be drawn from the figures for 1991 was that the proportion of boys and girls within the different subject areas had not changed much during the past 15 years .
The most clearly marked differences had been noted in home economics and aesthetic subjects , where the proportion of boys had increased considerably .
In 1976 , boys had represented only 4.9 per cent and 7.2 per cent respectively of the students in those two areas , as against 22.3 per cent and 15.7 per cent respectively in 1991 .
22 . In principle there were equal opportunities for boys and girls in vocational education and training .
The proportion of women in vocational training was fairly high ; however , girls still mainly tended to choose traditional women &apos;s occupations , and boys men &apos;s occupations .
A special secretariat in the Ministry of Education , Research and Church Affairs dealt with equality issues in education and tried to break down traditional barriers and patterns of choice with regard to studies and careers .
The Standing Committee on Church and Education in the Storting had recommended that the school counselling services should be strengthened to encourage girls to take up traditional men &apos;s occupations .
23 . The teaching of human rights was a basic element of Norwegian education , laid down in the Education Act and in the curriculum guidelines for primary and secondary schools .
Tolerance and equality were taught from the first years of primary school .
The curriculum included teaching about the central international human rights instruments .
Furthermore , the different aspects of human rights were explicitly included in the teaching of other subjects such as civics , religious instruction and home economics .
24 . With regard to the education of adult refugees and immigrants , Norwegian policy was based on the principle that refugees and immigrants who had not completed their basic education received the same treatment as Norwegians in that situation .
However , the Ministry of Education , Research and Church Affairs was particularly concerned to allow refugees and immigrants access to basic education on favourable conditions .
The Ministry had completed a curriculum in 1992 for formal basic education adapted to adult immigrants and refugees which had been distributed to the municipalities for implementation beginning in the current year .
The municipalities were responsible for its implementation , as they were responsible for all compulsory schooling .
The objective was to give immigrants the possibility of obtaining a certificate equivalent to the Norwegian lower secondary level certificate .
25 . The teaching of adult immigrants and refugees was a high-priority area in Norwegian educational policy and considerable resources were allocated to it every year , especially to courses in Norwegian .
Adult immigrants were offered an introductory course of 240 teaching hours free of charge , and refugees were offered 500 hours , with an extension of 250 hours if necessary , also free of charge .
In general those courses were financed by extra grants awarded to municipalities , and were often organized in cooperation with adult education organizations .
Activities targeted at immigrant groups had also been initiated as part of the national follow-up of the International Literacy Year in 1990 .
26 . The National Curriculum Guidelines for Compulsory Education of 1987 stated that the children of migrants or refugees &quot; shall have the same opportunities , rights and obligations as their fellow pupils whose mother tongue is Norwegian &quot; .
The basic principle of the Norwegian educational system , that all children had the right to schooling in accordance with their abilities , naturally also applied to them .
The Guidelines explicitly stated that all children of migrants and refugees should be prepared for life in Norwegian society and should receive instruction in Norwegian .
At the same time those children had to be given the opportunity to maintain and develop their own cultural identity through being taught their mother tongue .
The Guidelines contained chapters on mother-tongue teaching for immigrants and on Norwegian as a second language .
The Ministry gave direct grants to local authorities to ensure adequate facilities for mother-tongue teaching .
It was emphasized that the multicultural factor added a new dimension to Norwegian society and enriched the social and cultural life of the schools .
Norway participated actively in the innovative work and projects of the OECD and the Council of Europe on the integration of migrant children in schools .
A &quot; Threshold Level of Norwegian &quot; had been developed as part of the Council of Europe &apos;s project on modern languages .
That work had been useful in the drawing up of curricula for the teaching of Norwegian as a second language at school and in adult education .
27 . In the case of minority groups , 75 to 80 per cent of children in compulsory education in 1991-1992 received teaching in their native language .
At present some 80 different mother tongues were taught in Norwegian schools .
Such teaching was not always requested and qualified teachers for some languages were difficult to find , but high priority was being given to special teacher training courses .
28 . With regard to the steps taken to ensure equal access to higher education for groups which hitherto had had limited access , government policy in recent years had been to increase the numbers of men and women of all ages at all levels of higher education .
An important factor in that development was the large number of colleges of higher education distributed throughout the country and the extra resources that were being channelled into such education .
Student numbers had increased by 50 per cent , i.e. from 100,000 to 150,000 between 1988 and 1992 , 45,000 more students than originally predicted .
The proportion of students transferring from secondary school to higher education had risen from 16 per cent in 1981 to 34 per cent in 1990 .
The high priority given to education at all levels had resulted in a general rise in the educational level of the population ; the numbers continuing education after the age of 16 had risen from 30 per cent in 1970 to over 50 per cent in 1990 .
Over the same period the proportion receiving higher education had risen from 6.7 per cent to 14.1 per cent and that receiving upper secondary education from 23.9 per cent to 39.8 per cent , whereas the proportion receiving compulsory education had fallen from 69.4 per cent to 46.1 per cent .
29 . The Committee had asked what percentage of the handicapped population was attending special schools .
It was important to keep in mind that Norway endeavoured as a basic principle to integrate all pupils as far as possible into ordinary schools and into the local community .
The number of pupils in special schools was thus relatively low .
The number of special State schools had been reduced , and in their place 20 national resource centres for special education were being introduced from 1 August 1992 , each covering education for a specific disability .
Research and development programmes were also part of the reorganization .
The figures for 1988-1989 showed that 6 per cent of all pupils in compulsory education had special educational needs .
Ninety per cent of them attended ordinary schools or special classes at ordinary schools , and that integration process continued in upper secondary school .
Regulations giving priority to pupils with special educational needs had come into force in 1987 .
Detailed figures were available for the distribution of pupils between different types of schools or institutions .
During the 1992 / 93 school year , 900 pupils in the 7-19 age group were attending the national resource centres on a full-time basis , corresponding to 0.6 per cent of the total school population at primary and secondary level .
30 . General matters concerned with the terms and conditions of the employment of civil servants , including teachers , were negotiated between the unions and the Ministry of Labour and Government Administration .
Teachers had the right to strike but only on the basis of such negotiations .
More detailed aspects of working conditions within the school system were conducted between individual teachers &apos; unions and the Ministry of Education , Research and Church Affairs .
Current issues under discussion were the number of teacher working hours per school year and the requirement for teachers to spend non-teaching time at school .
The salaries and conditions of work of teachers in comparison with staff in comparable posts in the public and private sector varied depending on the teacher &apos;s qualification and the sector concerned .
The salaries of teachers with a general teacher &apos;s certificate obtained after three years &apos; training were usually slightly higher than the salaries of other staff in the public sector with a similar length of training ( i.e. librarians , pre-school teachers , health and social welfare and administrative staff ) , but in the private sector some administrative posts ( i.e. in banks ) with lower educational requirements were better paid .
However , 65 per cent of teachers had taken a further year of training for the qualification of adjunkt , which carried a higher salary .
From 1993 , basic teacher training would be extended to four years and achievement of adjunkt status would be automatic .
31 . Teachers with post-graduate qualifications , particularly those with a certain degree of seniority , were better paid than their colleagues in the public sector ( central or local government administration ) but the same was not always true in the private sector .
Salaries were considerably higher , for example , in the oil industry which in the 1980s had attracted many qualified science teachers .
Salaries were also higher in engineering , medicine , architecture and the law .
Although on average the salaries of the teaching profession had lagged behind other sectors in the early 1980s , between 1987 and 1990 they had increased at a rate 1.8 per cent higher than those of other groups .
Recent fluctuations in the labour market had highlighted the stability of the teaching profession as opposed to work in the private sector .
In the relatively few private schools in Norway conditions for teachers were generally the same as in the State schools .
32 . A number of questions had been asked on article 15 , which covered the right to take part in cultural life .
There were no serious regional disparities in Norway with regard to access to culture and cultural facilities , since the decentralization of cultural facilities that had been government policy for the past 20 years was largely complete .
In that connection , it should be mentioned that every one of Norway &apos;s 448 municipalities had its own public library .
With a view to increasing general accessibility to cultural activities , the Ministry of Culture gave considerable support to different art activities organized at regional and local level throughout the country as well as support to some institutions at the national level such as orchestras , musical groups and a theatre company which performed throughout the country .
At local level , many voluntary organizations and religious institutions initiated a wide range of cultural activities , thus playing an essential role in cultural life .
There were few significant differences between the various regions in the use made of most cultural institutions .
Although distance had some effect in the use made of any given facility , interest in a particular cultural activity was the most decisive motivating factor and lack of interest was the principal reason cited for not attending cultural exhibitions and productions and sporting events .
On the other hand , there were no regional disparities as regards the number of types of mass media patronized , although the popularity of each did vary from region to region .
33 . Turning to the specific measures implemented on behalf of the Sami people , she said that under article 110 ( a ) of the Norwegian Constitution they were assured of conditions enabling them to preserve and develop their language , culture and way of life .
Similar provisions were contained in section 1-1 of the Sami Act of 1987 , which also established the Sami Assembly , a mainly advisory body with some executive powers .
In addition , the Sami Educational Council gave advice to the Ministry of Education and other agencies on Sami educational affairs and a Sami College of Education had been established in 1989 .
Regular broadcasting in the Sami language had taken place since 1947 .
The right to learn Sami had become part of Norwegian law in 1967 and had recently been strengthened by further measures .
Children in Sami districts were entitled to be educated in or be taught the Sami language and outside Sami districts , children with a Sami background might receive education in Sami .
In December 1990 , Sami speakers had been given the right to use their language in dealings with local and regional authorities .
Special arrangements had been made to facilitate that practice , particularly in six municipalities in the counties of Finnmark and Troms forming the administrative area for the Sami language where special rules applied because of the large number of Sami speakers .
Legislation and official announcements and forms in that area had to appear in both Sami and Norwegian and the authorities responsible for the area were also required to reply to written communications from members of the public in Sami .
Affirmative action for the benefit of the Sami people was part of official policy , and such measures had been implemented in many fields in addition to legal provisions , financial and organizational measures to carry through that policy .
Approximately NKr 200 million was allocated each year in direct State support for various activities , institutions , etc .
34 . With regard to the weight given to culture in development plans , the Ministry of Cultural Affairs had in 1992 made a detailed survey of cultural policy and the aims of government policy , which , since the 1970s , had been to decentralize the administration of public cultural funds to municipal and county levels .
All counties and most municipalities now had a cultural administration .
In the 1990s , considerable emphasis was being placed on the cultural dimension of development , the importance of cultural factors as key variables in overall development and the inclusion of culture in all development policies and projects .
The acknowledgement of the cultural dimension of development was a major objective of the United Nations World Decade for Cultural Development ( 1988-1997 ) , and Norway had participated actively in its implementation .
On the initiative of Norway and the other Nordic countries , a World Commission on Culture and Development was to be established by the end of 1992 , under the joint auspices of UNESCO and the United Nations .
It was difficult to specify the percentage of government resources that were being devoted to cultural ends because such funds were administered by several different ministries .
35 . The Committee had asked whether Norway was considering the possibility of eliminating the time-limit placed on the protection accorded the work of authors and artists .
In reply to that question , she pointed out that the moral interests of authors and other artists were protected in sections 3 and 48 of the Norwegian Copyright Act of 12 May 1961 , and were not subject to a time-limit .
Sections 40 and 42 of the Act protected the material rights of authors , other artists and performing artists for 50 years after their deaths , a period that was not considered restrictive by the Bern Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention , to both of which Norway was a party .
There were no plans at present to amend the Norway Copyright Act .
36 . Replying to the question about Norway &apos;s scientific and cultural cooperative relations with countries other than the European Community , she said that Norway had a large-scale involvement in international , scientific and cultural cooperation , either as part of bilateral and multilateral agreements or through participation in international organizations and conferences .
She should , however , add that Norway was not a member of the European Community .
37 . Norway participated in the activities of international organizations such as the Nordic Council of Ministers , the Council of Europe , the OECD , UNESCO and the ECE , and maintained worldwide contacts with other countries as part of that cooperation .
It was represented on various policy committees , subgroups , projects , etc. organized under the auspices of those organizations .
Although it was an EFTA country , Norway participated in some European Community programmes on education and was also actively involved in the Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development ; that cooperation would be extended considerably under the EEA Agreement .
38 . Norway participated in a number of European research programmes and institutions and was also engaged in research cooperation on a broader international scale .
It participated in the International Agency for Research on Cancer , and was also particularly involved in research related to the developing countries , mainly through UNFPA , UNRISD , WHO or specific agreements .
It took an active part in the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research , a joint initiative of the United Nations and the World Bank .
It was a member of the Nordic Africa Institute , which was particularly concerned with research on North-South issues .
39 . Norway had bilateral cooperation with countries in various parts of the world , including agreements on exchanges of specialists in education , research workers and expertise .
40 . The number of bilateral school exchanges had increased considerably since 1990 and many Norwegian schools participated in UNESCO &apos;s Associated Schools Project .
The number of exchange programmes and agreements linking Norwegian universities and other institutions of higher education with higher education institutions in different parts of the world was increasing rapidly .
A Centre for International University Cooperation had therefore been established to coordinate those activities and to administer a special programme of institutional cooperation with developing countries in cooperation with the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
The Centre also served as the Norwegian coordinating unit for exchanges under the ERASMUS Programme .
41 . The new contacts with countries in central and eastern Europe were being given a high priority in current Norwegian educational policies and a programme of action to assist those countries had been launched by the Norwegian Government in 1992 .
42 . Mrs. Bonoan-Dandan took the Chair .
43 . The CHAIRMAN expressed appreciation to the representatives of Norway for their statements and invited the members of the Committee and representatives of the specialized agencies to make comments or put questions .
44 . Mr. SIMMA commended the manner in which Norway had discharged its reporting obligations under the Covenant ; it should serve as a model for future efforts .
It would have been even better , however , had the answers to the Committee &apos;s questions been made available in advance to Committee members .
45 . With regard to the legal obligation on the part of the local authorities to establish follow-up services for young people , what measures were available to persuade young persons choosing to terminate their training in the middle of a course of the unwisdom of that action ?
In many countries apprentices were regarded by employers as a form of cheap labour . Was that the case in Norway and , if so , what means of appeal and redress were available to young people to counter such practices ?
One of the minimum requirements for matriculation in Norway was a specific level of achievement in science / environmental studies . How was that praiseworthy emphasis on the environment to be reconciled with the Norwegian Government &apos;s current attitude towards whaling ?
With regard to the proportion of girls and boys in given areas of study , was he to understand that as many as two thirds of girls in vocational training chose to opt out of physical education ?
46 . How was sex education handled in Norway , in particular in the context of avoiding unwanted pregnancy and combating the increasing prevalence of sexually-transmitted diseases including AIDS .
47 . Mr. TEXIER noted from Norway &apos;s &quot; core document &quot; ( HRI / CORE / 1 / Add.6 ) a declaration by the Norwegian Government in 1989 that international instruments to which Norway was a party should be either incorporated into Norwegian domestic law or the latter adapted accordingly .
The issue had apparently been widely publicized in Norway and a committee of jurists set up to examine the question and report on it in early 1993 .
He asked whether that report had yet been submitted and what the present status of international instruments was in Norway .
48 . Mr. SPARSIS sought more information on how Norway ensured that the system of apprenticeship training referred to in the Norwegian presentation was not used as a means of exploitation and what rules governed the apprenticeship contract . What were the rights and obligations of employers and employees ? Was there a procedure to monitor whether the apprenticeship contract was being properly applied ? What was the scope and nature of the participation of the social partners in the formulation and implementation of apprenticeship policies and programmes ?
Was the apprenticeship scheme financed by the State budget , a pay-roll levy , the contribution of employees or a tripartite arrangement involving the State , employers and employees ?
49 . It had been stated that around 4,900 young people had been registered as unemployed .
He asked what percentage that was of total unemployment and whether it was higher or lower than the percentage of unemployed women , high school graduates and university graduates . What measures were being implemented to provide young people with gainful employment ?
50 . According to the Norwegian delegation , girls still tended to choose traditional women &apos;s occupations . Was that due to the pay , and did Norway have legislation ensuring equal pay for women ? Might that choice be a result of the refusal by employers to promote women , thus creating a disincentive for women to enter the labour market ? Or did women have little interest in a career ?
51 . Mention had been made of negotiations between teachers and the Government on setting pay and conditions of employment , but that was only a first step . What happened if negotiations collapsed ? Was there an effort by the State to bring the two parties together to reach an agreement ?
If no agreement could be reached , was there a third step , an arbitration procedure , whereby teachers could state their case before an independent body ? How did teachers &apos; pay compare with that of employees in other areas of the public and private sector ? Was there an independent research service to establish such statistics , which could then be used in collective bargaining ?
52 . Mr. MUTERAHEJURU asked for information on the relationship between religion and education in Norway . Were any courses in religion offered by the churches ? What was the impact of religious matters upon education and teaching ? How many courses on religion were offered in primary and secondary schools ?
53 . Did persons of foreign origin living in Norway participate fully in the cultural life of the country ?
54 . He noted that measures had been taken to ensure the religious rights of the Sami population , and he wondered whether the same was true for Norway &apos;s foreign population .
Did the specific measures taken for the Sami people contribute to their integration in Norwegian society or , on the contrary , did it lead to their exclusion ?
55 . Mrs. JIMENEZ BUTRAGUEÑO asked whether there were specific programmes to help with finding employment for university graduates ? What was being done to improve the employment chances of persons older than 45 years of age who had been out of work for long periods ? What was the role of continuing education for adults ? Was there an on-job training programme to provide adults with new skills ?
56 . What was the retirement age for teachers ? Was there a trend towards deferring the retirement age ? Could retired persons take part in continuing education courses ? How did the educational system avail itself of the expertise of retired persons ?
57 . Did special adult education programmes exist for the elderly ? Could the elderly benefit fully from cultural activities in Norway ? Were the elderly granted price reductions for museum and theatre tickets ? Were they encouraged to improve their educational level ?
In view of the lower income of the elderly , such benefits were of considerable importance . Was there an awareness that elderly persons were entitled to such benefits ?
58 . Mr. RATTRAY asked to what extent reforms in secondary school education were designed to respond to the changing structure of the Norwegian economy , in particular the trend towards globalization .
59 . According to the Norwegian delegation , unemployment had meant that increasing numbers of young people were turning to education , but that the number of apprenticeship places had shown a decline . Was that an indication of a shift to the service industries and away from industries that used apprentices ? On what sectors of the economy were the unemployed focusing their attention in their search for job opportunities ?
He noted that as part of the educational reform , persons between 16 and 19 years of age had the legal right to 3 years of upper secondary education and that the authorities had the corresponding legal obligation to establish follow-up services . Was that a development that was moving in the direction of requiring compulsory education for that age group ? Did the reform programme foreshadow that change ?
Whereas the Norwegian delegation had stated that in the labour market high priority must be given to persons between 16 and 19 years of age , the reform of the educational system had created the legal obligation to provide opportunities for higher education to that age group . Was that not a contradiction ? Did Norwegian strategy ensure that the greater opportunities and better facilities provided to that age group were actually used , and not diverted to other areas in response to the situation on the labour market ?
60 . Concerning the statistics on vocational training of boys and girls , he wondered whether there was a correlation between the choice made and wages . Were choices dictated not only by gender but also by the rewards ?
61 . He sought clarification on the decline in the percentage of persons taking advantage of compulsory education , which according to the Norwegian delegation had fallen from 69 per cent in 1970 to 46 per cent in 1990 .
62 . Mr. NENEMAN welcomed the comprehensive information provided , which contrasted with the rather short original report .
He inquired why there had been a gap of nearly 10 years between the initial report and the second periodic report .
63 . Turning to a number of specific points in Norway &apos;s second periodic report ( E / 1990 / 7 / Add.7 ) , he sought clarification as to what was meant by the alternative model of fundamental education referred in paragraph 6 .
Paragraph 10 had spoken of annual budgetary contributions for cultural purposes . How were such contributions distributed , and on what basis were priorities set ? Was emphasis placed on classical or on popular culture ?
The meeting rose at 12.05 p.m.

GE.92-13158 ( E )
The meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY AS AN ESSENTIAL CONDITION FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS , ABOVE ALL THE RIGHT TO LIFE ( agenda item 14 ) ( E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1991 / 32 and Corr.1 )
1 . Mr. CISSE ( Centre for Human Rights ) , introducing agenda item 14 , recalled that the Sub-Commission had decided by its resolution 1985 / 1 that the item should be entitled &quot; International peace and security as an essential condition for the enjoyment of human rights , above all the right to life &quot; and , by its decision 1985 / 34 that it would be considered on a biennial basis .
In 1989 , the Sub-Commission had invited one of its members , Mr. Murlidhar Bhandare , to prepare a working paper on the interrelationship between international peace and the effective materialization of all human rights , particularly the right to life and to development .
Mr. Bhandare had presented the working paper at the forty-third session of the Sub-Commission which had decided , by its decision 1991 / 106 , to defer consideration until its forty-fourth session .
The Sub-Commission therefore had before it , for its consideration of item 14 , that working paper , published in document E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1991 / 32 and Corr.l.
2 . Mr. KIRKYACHARIAN ( Movement against Racism and for Friendship among Peoples ) said that the events currently taking place in the former Yugoslavia caused many human rights advocates to feel remorse because they had not insisted sufficiently that the political leaders should act before it was too late , because it had soon become apparent that rational discussion had become impossible and that the situation would deteriorate .
Not only the United Nations and its various organs but also the NGOs and their activitists should accept that it was not enough to say &quot; Nothing is worse than war &quot; or to denounce one or other of the parties involved , but above all that what was needed was to put forward practical and concrete proposals , however limited they might be .
3 . The Balkans were not the only region in the world where war , inherently absurd , barred the road to commonsense solutions .
In the Gulf region which had been the cradle of civilization and where the prophets of Western monotheism had preached , it was continuing to leave its scars .
It was not Saddam Hussein but the people of Iraq who suffered the terrible consequences of the embargo against Iraq .
Good sense should dissociate the sanctions against Iraq more clearly from the unjust privations inflicted on the population of that country .
One must also hope that the international community would find a policy which would sharply limit sales of arms until they were banned once and for all by universal disarmament .
In Israel , the recent elections had revived hopes for a peaceful issue to the Middle East conflict .
The announcement of the repeal of the law prohibiting Israelis from meeting members of the PLO was an encouraging sign .
The obstacles to coexistence between the two communities continued to be numerous , but they could be removed if the Israeli State admitted the existence of a Palestinian people with a right to an independent life within a safe and recognized State structure , since Palestinians had long abandoned the practice of referring to the &quot; Zionist entity &quot; .
There was still time to help to build two States since there were also two peoples .
4 . With regard to the situation in Karabakh , which was called Artsagh in Armenian , he regretted the slowness of the negotiations to end the conflict .
It was true that the Azeri party denied the obvious , namely , the Armenian character of that region , and all would find it easy to understand that the Baku and Sumgait massacres had left deep scars in the consciousness of Armenians .
No effort should be spared to put an end to the hatred and the desire for revenge and to bring about an understanding between partners for whom coexistence was an inevitability .
The Russian State , as the heir to the Soviet State , should assume special responsibility in the peace process for a land which had already suffered enough .
It was worth while to recall that 200 years earlier Kant had linked the idea of moral progress to that of political enlightenment and peace among nations , thus clearly establishing the parameters of the current problem .
5 . Mr. BANDIER ( International Association of Educators for World Peace ) said that he deeply regretted that all the efforts deployed to put an end to certain problems were sometimes neutralized by the obstructive behaviour of Governments which saw themselves as the champions of democracy and of the defence of human rights and which , while claiming to work for international peace and security , nevertheless continued deliberately to infringe the principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in all other related international instruments .
If there was a genuine will to achieve a fairer , more human and more balanced , and therefore better world , certain concepts needed to be thought out again and a number of structures at the international level changed drastically .
Not a day went by without events that bore the germs of discord and even conflict which might well spread revived fears of many peoples that their hopes would be destroyed .
The situation was particularly serious and disquieting since the world population would reach 6 billion at the end of the twentieth century , in other words in the very near future .
The world and mankind as a whole were seriously ill ; they suffered not just from a physical infirmity which had been discussed at length at the Rio Summit but also from the effects of a moral and spiritual pollution that was still more harmful and destructive than atmospheric pollution .
One should not allow oneself to be deluded by the optimism voiced by a number of international strategists and leaders because it was a fact that the survival of man was threatened .
It was therefore important to work unremittingly for the preservation of a right that had priority , because it was natural and based on human , traditional and fundamental values , namely the right to life from which all other rights stemmed .
6 . The preservation of the right to life also meant the survival of mankind but that would be possible only when all human beings , without any distinction based on race , colour , belief , sex , origin , culture or social situation , could have access to a fair division of the wealth of the planet and when the various forms of inequality , human and social , all disappeared .
If that was to come about , each person must be able to exercise the rights recognized to him by various international instruments which , if they were properly applied , would secure the well-being of all , in all spheres and on all continents .
Respect for those rights would guarantee peace in the world , as there could not be peace without social justice and without freedom .
One must therefore strive , using all the means available , to eliminate the flagrant contradictions that still existed between the spirit and the letter of the international human rights instruments and the situation as it was in order to guarantee universal and effective implementation of all the principles they established ; a start might be made by urging all States to respect them as they had the obligation to do .
It was important to awaken to the concept of duty which went hand in hand with that of right and it was therefore imperative that the duties of each individual vis-à-vis society should be defined clearly and precisely in an additional protocol .
Education had an important role to play in that sphere because children and young people were the future of the world .
It was obvious that peace could not prevail as long as men disregarded their duties vis-à-vis others and society in general .
Solutions had to be found to end hunger , suffering , injustice , inequality , hatred , terror , discrimination and the humiliations endured by so many human beings throughout the world and a climate of comprehension had to be established which would make possible a resolute universal conviviality among men , peoples and ultimately nations. page
7 . Mr. Sachar took the Chair .
8 . Mr. van WALT ( Pax Christi International ) said that the interrelatedness of respect for human rights and the maintenance of international peace and security had been clear from the time when the Sub-Commission had decided , by its decision 4 ( XXXIV ) of 10 September 1981 , to include for the first time on its agenda the item entitled &quot; The effects of gross violations of human rights on international peace and security &quot; .
The conflict in the former Yugoslavia and some parts of the former Soviet Union were cases in point .
In the present context , the Sub-Commission should concern itself mainly with situations of imminent conflict before they occurred .
For instance , in Kosovo , the Serbian authorities had openly admitted to pursuing a policy of ethnic cleansing of the non-Serb population , which was 90 per cent Albanian , and which had been victims of discrimination for years : that policy might well lead to massacres , war and unprecedented human rights abuses .
In Abkhazia , rising political tension between the nationalistic Georgian authorities and the Abkhaz Government could develop into full-scale war as it had done in South Ossetia .
The problem was essentially a political one , concerning the distribution of authority and could therefore be resolved through negotiation if the international community made an effort to persuade the parties to negotiate .
In Bougainville , the situation had deteriorated to the point where the right to life of the population was no longer guaranteed since the Government of Papua New Guinea had put the island under blockade and effectively prevented essential supplies , including medical supplies , from reaching the people .
Finally , in the Philippines , multiple violations of human rights of the indigenous populations were being committed , on the pretext of safeguarding national security .
Those were but a few examples of the many situations that were not being addressed adequately by the international community because they had not reached the front pages of the sensation-seeking press .
Governments also feared to be accused of interfering in the internal affairs of other States .
Experience had shown , however , that once fighting broke out , international peace and security were affected ; open conflict in Kosovo and Abkhazia would invariably involve neighbouring countries , as had the wars in the former Yugoslavia and in South Ossetia .
In Bougainville , the conflict had already assumed an international dimension with the shelling of a port in the Solomon Islands by the forces of Papua New Guinea at the beginning of the year .
9 . If the United Nations was often unable to detect tensions which might well lead to conflict , it was , in part , because it did not provide the representatives of nations , peoples and minorities whose rights were being disregarded an opportunity of speaking directly without intermediaries in the human rights bodies .
It would also be helpful if , during its special session , the Commission on Human Rights extended such a possibility to the peoples affected by the conflict in Yugoslavia .
It was before conflicts generated into full-scale war that organs such as the Sub-Commission could have an impact on the responsible decision makers .
Action by the Sub-Commission along those lines was therefore essential in the case of Kosovo , Abkhazia and Bougainville .
10 . Mr. MATARASSO ( International League for the Rights and Liberation of Peoples ) said that every situation of armed conflict unquestionably sparked off serious and massive human rights abuses .
It followed that crimes against peace were crimes that came within the competence of the law of nations , which together with war crimes and crimes against humanity , formed the classical trilogy of international criminal offences specified in article 6 of the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal .
That had been reaffirmed by the United Nations General Assembly in resolution 95 ( I ) of 11 December 1946 by which it had affirmed &quot; the principles of international law recognized by the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal and the judgement of the Tribunal &quot; , as well as in resolution 3314 ( XXIX ) of 14 December 1974 on the definition of aggression , which stated that &quot; A war of aggression is a crime against international peace &quot; .
It had to be acknowledged , however , that no action had been taken so far to prosecute and punish the authors of such crimes .
From 1946 onward , consideration had in fact been given to the possibility of setting up an international penal tribunal which would have jurisdiction in that regard and which was mentioned in article VI of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of 1948 , but that idea had never been taken up .
It would therefore be worth while , today , for the Sub-Commission to study the advisability and possibility of setting up an international penal tribunal which , like the International Court of Justice established under the Charter of the United Nations , would be composed of independent judges .
11 . Mr. WADLOW ( World Federalist Movement ) quoted the words of Mr. Bhandhare in his working paper E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1991 / 32 in respect of the complex relationship between international peace and the realization of human rights : &quot; this relationship has now assumed a more dynamic form than at any time since the creation of the United Nations &quot; .
That statement was illustrated by the recent initiative of the United Nations Secretary-General who , in his report entitled An Agenda for Peace ( A / 47 / 277 ) , warned that the peace mission would demand the concerted attention of States , of regional and non-governmental organizations and of all the United Nations system .
In his conclusions , the Secretary-General stressed the important role of non-governmental organizations .
12 . The non-governmental organizations had already played an important role in early warning fact-finding and , to a lesser degree , in mediation in conflict situations .
Unfortunately their efforts had been inadequate .
He wished to cite three examples .
The first was that of Yugoslavia ; his organization had warned the Commission on Human Rights at its 1991 session of growing tensions among nationalities in that country , but had not been able to convince it to take action .
The Commission was about to meet in special session at a time when the question had taken on a dimension and complexity that creative action in February 1991 could have avoided .
The second case was that of Nagorny-Karabakh .
It had been brought to the attention of the Commission and the Sub-Commission repeatedly , but the region had slid into violence at an ever more rapid rate and it was much more difficult to act now than it would have been at an earlier stage .
Finally , there was the case of Myanmar where , although the situation had been studied by special rapporteurs , the situation remained violent and there was a real danger of growing instability as the flow of refugees increased .
13 . He hoped that the Sub-Commission would henceforth prove equal to its task .
He wished to raise , in particular , the question of the ethnic Russian inhabitants of the Republics of the former USSR .
In those newly independent countries , Russians were seen as colonizers , as opportunists and as profiteers .
They might at any time be the target of violence and be compelled to flee en masse .
If nothing was done to avert that danger , the establishment of democracy and of a liberal economic system in the former Soviet Union would certainly be endangered .
Thus , such a complex situation must be kept under review and the advice of the Centre for Human Rights and the non-governmental organizations should be offered .
14 . Mrs. MARKS ( Women &apos;s International League for Peace and Freedom ) pointed out that while all sectors of the population were affected in the context of war and conflict , women were most affected . Urging the human rights bodies of the United Nations to act more energetically , she illustrated her remark by a number of examples .
She drew attention , first of all , to the ill-treatment , today common knowledge , inflicted on Korean &quot; comfort women &quot; by Japanese soldiers during the Second World War , but she also referred to a situation that was virtually glossed over by the media , namely , that of the thousands of Korean prostitutes who catered to the nearly 40,000 American servicemen based in South Korea and who were exposed to physical and psychological violence by their customers .
They also found themselves in a particularly difficult situation when the men in the family were put under administrative detention , when a curfew was enforced , when the family was placed under house arrest or when the family house was demolished , since it was they who then had to assure the psychological , moral and material welfare of the family .
Because of their marginalization , they were among the poorest in the region .
She drew attention to the case of widows , victims of military activity in Guatemala , who had begun to organize themselves in groups such as CONAVIGUA ( National Coordination for the Widows of Guatemala ) to enable them to participate in public life and to make known their difficulties and suffering ; that initiative hase put them in a still more difficult situation since they now received death threats .
15 . The Women &apos;s International League for Peace and Freedom therefore requested the United Nations human rights bodies , and in particular the Sub-Commission , to recognize that women were affected in special ways by each type of human rights violation and to discuss that aspect of that question under each item on their agenda and to appoint a special rapporteur on women , whose mandate would be to study the human rights status of women , especially in situations of war and conflict , to identify types of human rights violations which affected women only and ways in which women were specifically affected by other types of human rights violations and , finally , to monitor the work of the Sub-Commission and other United Nations human rights bodies and to evaluate the way they took account of questions of relevance to women .
16 . Mr. LITTMAN ( International Fellowship of Reconciliation ) , referring to the question of the proliferation of chemical and bacteriological weapons , expressed surprise at the shelving of draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1991 / L.2 on that subject , discussion of which the Sub-Commission had decided to postpone .
He recalled that at the fortieth session , he had deplored the indifference of the international community to the intensive use of chemical weapons by Iraq against enemy soldiers and against its own Kurdish civilian population .
Each year , since then he had provided further information on the chemical warfare programmes of Iran , Iraq , Syria and Libya , which had enjoyed the assistance of firms , mostly German , but also American , British , French , Italian , Austrian and Swiss .
He stressed that the United Nations had not published certain of that information , because it was too politically &quot; sensitive &quot; and considered that the United States initiative evoking the possibility of creating an international tribunal to judge those who committed acts of genocide and torture would have been more credible if it had been taken before 2 August 1990 .
He recalled that in 1990 he had suggested that consideration should be given to appointing a special rapporteur to list those companies which traded in poison gas and those States which were unwilling to intervene when their nationals engaged in that trade .
The following year , in the midst of the Gulf war , he had reiterated his appeal and drawn attention to the report by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre entitled The Poison Gas Connection .
The report had been prepared by Mr. Kenneth Timmerman who had since also published a book entitled The Death Lobby , and very recently a report in which he revealed that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was not for tomorrow but for today and proposed the creation of an international proliferation control agency .
The International Fellowship of Reconciliation was ready to transmit that report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations .
He suggested that it should be studied by the sponsors of the draft resolution left pending at the Sub-Commission &apos;s previous session and requested the Sub-Commission to resume consideration of E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1991 / L.2 with a view to its adoption .
17 . Mr. DAWALIBI ( Observer for the Syrian Arab Republic ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , pointed out that the representative of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation who had protested against the presence of chemical weapons in Syria was known for the lack of objectivity of his statements .
All were aware that Syria advocated the elimination of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .
The representative of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation had not mentioned the nuclear weapon in the position of Israel which constituted a threat to peace and security in that region of the world .
He believed that the agenda item under consideration should deal with obstacles to peace , including instances of foreign occupation .
18 . Mrs. MBONU recalled that the relationship between human rights , particularly economic and social rights , and the maintenance of international peace and security had always been recognized by the international community .
Indeed , if respect for human rights was conducive to the promotion of peace , the enjoyment of those rights was strongly jeopardized when peace did not prevail .
Thus , apartheid , with its concomitant of racial discrimination , genocide , colonialism , famine , etc . , engendered large-scale violations of human rights which threatened international peace and security .
The inequality in the exercise of human rights , in whatever area , should therefore be a matter of fundamental concern , from the viewpoint of international security .
19 . In his working paper , Mr. Bhandare had rightly stressed the complex relationship between international peace and the realization of human rights .
The end of the cold war had ended the ideological conflict between West and East on whether primacy should be given to the maintenance of international peace and security , considered by some as an essential precondition for the enjoyment of human rights , or whether the safeguarding of human rights and fundamental freedoms was a prerequisite for the maintenance of international peace and security .
In fact those two elements were totally indissociable : problems caused by economic disparities could give rise to social tension which was further exacerbated by State intervention and which could degenerate to the point of threatening peace and security at home and abroad .
Respect for human rights in their entirety was therefore necessary for national and international peace .
Thus , when the right to development was disregarded , as it was in the many countries prostrated under the burden of debt and the stringent financial measures imposed on them , the tensions engendered constituted threats to international peace and security .
In conclusion , she said that the United Nations should recognize the linkage between de facto enjoyment , the practical realization of human rights and peace as well as the fact that peace and development were essential for the realization of human rights and the exercise of fundamental freedoms .
20 . Mrs. MURCHIE ( Indigenous World Association ) said two significant anniversaries , the outbreak of the &quot; war to end wars &quot; in 1914 and the forty-seventh anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima had taken place the previous week and despite the intention , frequently and firmly expressed , of establishing a lasting peace , it seemed peace was still elusive .
Only by renouncing war and militarism would it be possible to implement fully the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
It was true that disarmament had been a major preoccupation of the League of Nations and then of the United Nations , but the major States which proclaimed themselves to be peace loving nevertheless allowed the manufacture of arms and the sale of arms to oppressive regimes in the third world , yielding to the lobbying of the merchants of death .
21 . As a member of an indigenous community and as a woman , she was excluded from taking decisions about the manufacture and trade of arms .
As a woman , she belonged to the category most exposed to the harmful consequences of militarism as well as to the violations that threatened the lives of indigenous peoples .
Those peoples were relegated to regions where their rights to traditional resources of land , minerals or water rights were denied .
Women were frontline activists in campaigning for the defence of the rights of their incarcerated relatives and in confronting the authorities , seeking information and the release of prisoners .
One such association was CONAVIGUA ( National Coordination for the Widows of Guatemala ) composed largely of indigenous widows .
As a result of their activities , they had been threatened with torture , rape and even death .
22 . To enable the United Nations to combat more actively the violations perpetrated against women because of their gender , the Indigenous World Association unreservedly supported the recommendation made early by the Women &apos;s International League for Peace and Freedom .
23 . Mr. BALIAN ( Human Rights Advocates ) expressed concern about the human rights situation in the countries of the former Soviet Union , where there were proliferating and increasingly violent nationality conflicts , shortcomings in the democratic institutions responsible for guaranteeing the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the new States , and the existence of critical environmental problems and disastrous social and economic conditions reminiscent of the conditions which had brought about the 1917 Revolution .
While those new States had primary responsible for settling those problems , the international community could , however , play a constructive role in helping them to overcome their difficulties , including finding a peaceful solution to the conflicts between various nationalities .
Most of those conflicts were the result of the arbitrarily determined borders of administrative and political subdivisions in the former Soviet Union and gross violations of human rights .
24 . A case in point was Nagorny-Karabakh , whose Armenian population had been appealing in vain for the past four or five years for help from the international community .
Predictably , the Armenians of Nagorny-Karabakh , left to face the brutality of the former Soviet Union and the violence of Azerbaijan , had been compelled to take up arms in order to protect their legitimate right to exist as a people on their territory .
Their legitimate act of self-defence had served as a pretext for Azerbaijan to unleash further massacres and to deport from their ancestral villages peoples who questioned the legitimacy of a State which could not protect its minorities .
Completely isolated , the people of Nagorny-Karabakh had declared their independence and the conflict between Nagorny-Karabakh and Azerbaijan had developed into a full-scale war with numerous civilian casualties on both sides .
25 . The international community &apos;s mediation effort had been welcomed by the Republic of Nagorny-Karabakh but had failed because of the conflicting geopolitical interests of the regional Powers .
Doubting whether the international community was capable or even willing to find an equitable solution to the conflict , the parties had then decided to stake everything on armed struggle , further aggravating the human rights situation in the region .
Any successful international mediation effort to restore a lasting peace in Nagorny Karabakh or in other regions affected by similar conflicts must be based on respect for human rights , including the right to self-determination . &quot; Sovereignty and territorial integrity must not be permitted to work against the principle of self-determination &quot; ( A / 47 / 277 , para . 19 ) .
Further , once a State ceased to represent equitably the interests of all its peoples it &quot; has the duty to refrain from forcible action which deprives the disenfranchised people of their right to self-determination , freedom and independence &quot; ( General Assembly resolution 2625 ( XXV ) adopted on 24 October 1970 ) .
Since Azerbaijan had ceased to represent the interests of its Armenian minority , the Armenians of Nagorny-Karabakh were entitled to exercise their right to self-determination .
The threats in the region to the existence of the Armenians and the lack of confidence between Armenians and Azeris precluded half measures such as &quot; cultural autonomy &quot; or &quot; autonomy with international guarantees &quot; which might have been a viable solution had the international community been able to intervene earlier .
26 . The United Nations human rights bodies , including the Sub-Commission , should , as the Secretary-General had stated in his An Agenda for Peace ( A / 47 / 277 ) , &quot; seek to identify at the earliest possible stage situations that could produce conflict , and to try through diplomacy to remove the sources of danger before violence results &quot; .
27 . Mr. EIDE said that if the Sub-Commission decided to undertake the study proposed by Mr. Bhandare in document E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1991 / 32 it needed to redefine the spirit in which it would be conducted .
In 1981 , when the Sub-Commission had begun to study the interrelationship between human rights and international peace , the cold war had still been on the agenda .
Today , instead of exploiting local and regional conflicts to strengthen their positions , the major Powers were endeavouring to cooperate in order to find solutions to them .
The gap that had separated political issues and human rights issues was closing .
Thus , in a few day &apos;s time , the Commission on Human Rights , meeting in special session , would examine a number of issues already discussed in the Security Council in connection with the former Yugoslavia .
28 . If peace was to be maintained , the territorial integrity of States , particularly that of the newly independent States that had made up the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia , must be respected .
In the latter case , the principle of territorial integrity had not been respected and the world was witnessing a savage process of ethnic purification , whose justification was the theory of ethno-nationalism according to which each ethnic group must have its own State in which minorities had no place .
Ethno-nationalism meant the exclusion of minorities or the limitation of their rights .
Thus , the majority would grant citizenship as it saw fit .
In that connection , he expressed concern at the evolution of legislation on citizenship in Latvia and in Estonia and the consequences that might have on the stability not just of those two countries but of the entire region .
In Georgia , President Gamsakhurdia had unfortunately implemented an ethno-nationalist policy and had adopted the slogan &quot; Georgia for the Georgians &quot; .
Since only 60 per cent of Georgian citizens were ethnic Georgians , that policy made for a large number of excluded persons .
Very fortunately , Mr. Shevardnadze was carrying out a different policy : in that way a temporary solution had been found for South Ossetia whose autonomy was guaranteed while respecting the territorial integrity of Georgia .
29 . Only a solution of that kind would enable peace to be restored to Nagorny-Karabakh .
It should be borne in mind that the will of some 160,000 Armenians of Nagorny-Karabakh to exercise their right to self-determination had led to the displacement and uprooting of at least 500,000 people in Nagorny-Karabakh , Azerbaijan and Armenia .
Autonomy must be restored to this region which , however , would continue to be an integral part of the territory of Azerbaijan .
So much hatred had built up , however , that the international community should ensure that the Azeris who had lived in Nagorny-Karabakh might return there without encountering discrimination and that suitable protection was guaranteed to the Armenians .
With regard to Bosnia , it should be noted that ethnic purification was not practised by the Serbs of Sarajevo but by rural Serbs who could unhesitatingly be described as facists .
It should also be noted that the Croats were not spared by ethno-nationalism .
The Serbian facists who were attacking Sarajevo with such violence did so because the town was a symbol of possible conviviality among the different Serb , Croat and Muslim communities .
In fact , the towns were places where those communities had learned to live together .
If the international community did not contribute to the restoration of peace while respecting the territorial integrity of States and human rights , including the rights of minorities , there could well be an extension of the conflicts in Bosnia as well as in Nagorny-Karabakh .
30 . Mr. BOUTKEVITCH said that any organized society was composed of three main elements , namely man , people , and State ; their respective essential legal attributions were the right to life , the right to self-determination and sovereignty .
Primacy must be given to the right to life without losing sight of the fact that man could develop fully within society .
States , unfortunately , seemed to relegate human rights to a position of secondary importance , attaching scant importance to the right to life .
Happily , the international community was coming round to the view that the defence of the right to life did not constitute a violation of the sovereignty of the State in which that right was flouted .
Ways and means had to be found of protecting the right to life by exerting pressure on States , groups and individuals who cause conflicts .
The international organizations should combine their efforts and States should increase their cooperation to develop machinery for the protection of that supreme right .
31 . Mr. AKTAN ( Observer for Turkey ) congratulated Mr. Eide on his statement with which he was virtually in total agreement .
His Government was endeavouring to promote the rights of ethnic minorities along the lines indicated by Mr. Eide .
International peace and security were regarded by the United Nations human rights system as an essential condition for the enjoyment of human rights and freedoms .
That statement gave the deceptive impression that , at times when international peace and security broke down , although their fundamental rights were impaired the peoples who were affected went on living as usual .
The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina was a case in point and the Sub-Commission had an obligation to consider it .
He did not think it necessary to dwell on the human suffering occurring in that region and on those who were responsible for it , since everyone knew all too well who they were .
Instead , he would concentrate on the implications in the short or long term of those events on the new international economic order .
He wished to stress , in particular , that without a domestic and international political order there could be no justice , no development and no human rights .
No political order was perfect , since every order reflected the imperfections of the life of society , and the human condition .
But the breakdown of order is more terrible still since it engendered anarchy .
32 . In Bosnia and Herzegovina , the fate of the international order was at stake .
It was important that it should be established and that the international community should mobilize itself , which it seemed to find difficult when principles conflicted with particular interests .
Everyone was aware that the aggression in Bosnia must be stopped without , however , managing to do so .
Such a situation meant a victory for aggression and a defeat for the international community .
He considered the maintenance of the order to be of primary importance and impotence to be more deadly than excesses of power .
If one refrained from intervening , on the pretext of the difficulty of the enterprise , the aggressor would always have his own way .
After Croatia , it would be the turn of Kosovo and Macedonia , where intervention would be as complicated as in Bosnia .
33 . Referring to the destiny of Europe , he said that it was paralysed by the tensions created within it by the juxtaposition of immense power and extreme weakness .
It was unaware that a second-best scenario was suicidal .
The concern shown by Europe in the problems of other continents was , in his view , a way of avoiding confronting the emblematic question of Bosnia , while cease-fire after cease-fire was violated .
To refrain from taking action or to seek to limit intervention to humanitarian aid to the victims was to confer legitimacy on the aggressor .
It amounted to that when one asked his permission to enter the camps to see that the inmates were well treated instead of challenging his right to open those camps and demanding that he should close them immediately .
34 . The Security Council envisaged the use of force only to be able to distribute humanitarian aid .
However , the situation called for very different solutions and the use of force only in order to distribute humanitarian aid amounted to acquiescing in the dismemberment of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the name of ethnic purity with all its disastrous consequences .
It was not just the new international order that was in peril but also the universal character of Western civilization .
The ethnic cleansing in Bosnia was paving the way for religious cleansing throughout Europe , starting in Macedonia and Kosovo .
It was not power nor influence that made for a universal civilization , but true pluralism which accommodated ethnic and religious diversity .
An increasingly parochial civilization would merely establish an order , but an order in which democracy and human rights would be concepts devoid of meaning could only be maintained by force .
Amid the sound and fury , a lament arose from the ruins of Sarajevo while the new international order agonized and the values of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment faded from the memory of those who were free but lacking in courage .
35 . Mr. BIJEDIC ( Observer for Bosnia and Herzegovina ) said that he wished to inform the Sub-Commission of the multiple and gross violations of human rights being perpetrated in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to warn against the consequences of that situation as far as peace and security in the region were concerned .
He wished , first of all , to protest against the simplification of the situation as well as the prejudice which was very prevalent in the West ; how was it possible to ascribe part of the blame on the victims of aggression planned in advance by the Presidency of Yugoslavia , the Yugoslav People &apos;s Army and the leadership of the Serbian Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina ?
Behind that aggression were the Governments of Serbia and Montenegro , which now constituted the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
The Yugoslav People &apos;s Army , with its 100,000 soldiers , 400 tanks , 80 aircraft and very large amounts of heavy arms , together with the terrorist wing of the Serbian Democratic Party and the assistance of fascistic Serbian and Montenegrin volunteers , was occupying the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina and terrorizing the population .
36 . There was no doubt about the existence of a plan of aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina , as well as against Croatia .
At the time when Bosnia and Herzegovina had proclaimed its independence Mr. Karadzic , a leader of the Serbian Democratic Party had warned the new Republic that there was a real prospect that the Muslims would disappear .
Since then , 50,000 people had been killed , of whom more than 80 per cent had been civilians and 10 per cent children ; hundreds of thousands had been injured and tens of thousands had disappeared .
Most of the deaths had so far been due to heavy artillery attacks , but more and more people were now dying of starvation .
Almost all the towns of the Republic , once the embodiment of peaceful coexistence and tolerance , had become places of desolation .
More than 1.5 million people had been made homeless , after being expelled , deported and penned up in internment camps .
More than 100 camps had been opened mostly for civilians .
Tens of thousands of corpses had also been transported far from the places of execution in an attempt to conceal the truth about the atrocities .
The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina was also an unprecedented example in history of cultural genocide and political totalitarianism .
37 . By way of example , he spoke of the town where he had been born , Mostar ; after 90 days of bombing and shelling , 90 per cent of the town had been destroyed , including 17 mosques , the Catholic cathedral , 3 monasteries and a sixteenth century library . Ninety per cent of schools had been destroyed as well as eight of the town &apos;s nine bridges .
Mostar , which had had a population of 126,000 now had only 30,000 , who had been joined by some 25,000 refugees , mostly Muslims from eastern Herzegovina , all of whom had witnessed atrocities .
The ethnic cleansing occurring in Bosnia , pursued by the present leaders of Serbia , was contrary to the real and great values of the Serbian people .
He considered that the events in his country constituted a violation of article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and he compared the discretion surrounding the question to the silence in which so many atrocities had been committed during the Second World War .
He paid a tribute to the journalists who had shown courage , including Mr. Leslie Gelb of the International Herald Tribune , who had not hesitated to say that while politicians in the West spoke of the horror of the camps , they did very little to put an end to what Mr. Jacques Delors might call a &quot; strategy of death &quot; .
Finally , he warned against the very real danger of &quot; Palestinization &quot; of the Muslims in the region , if those who were in a position to intervene failed to do so .
38 . Mr. MOLLA-ZADE ( Observer for Azerbaijan ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that he was proud to represent his country at the current session of the Sub-Commission , where for the first time the Azeri people had a voice .
In recent years , under the umbrella of human rights organizations and non-governmental organizations , the Armenian diaspora had been reporting on the situation in Armenia and Azerbaijan , but in an unduly biased way .
The violations of human rights occurring in Transcaucasia were in effect the consequence of the aggression perpetrated by Armenia against Azerbaijan .
When Armenians referred to violations of human rights , they spoke solely of those violations of which they were victims and never those of which they were guilty .
At the end of November 1988 , Armenia had been the scene of terrible violence : in a single week , more than 165,000 Azeris had been deported and some 159 people massacred , mostly in Gukark district .
On 1 December 1989 , the Supreme Soviet of Armenia had adopted a resolution on the unification of Nagorny-Karabakh with Armenia , in flagrant violation of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan .
Since that time , the Armenians had constantly attacked Azeri villages from their territory .
With the collapse of the Soviet Union , the Armenians had opted for a military solution and ethnic cleansing , expelling the Azeri population from Nagorny-Karabakh .
In January and February 1992 , the Armenian national army had attacked Azeri villages , killing civilians , destroying houses and taking hostages .
In the town of Khojoly alone , about 1,000 civilians had been killed .
Yet , Armenia continued to deny the presence of its troops in Nagorny-Karabakh and tried to convince the international community that it was in no way infringing the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and still less international law .
Since the beginning of 1992 , several fact-finding missions from CSCE and the United Nations had visited the region .
On 27 and 28 February 1992 , the first CSCE mission had presented its report to the Committee of Senior Officials of the CSCE , recommending a solution based on the principle of inviolability of frontiers and protection of the rights of minorities .
While the Azeri authorities indicated acceptance of the idea of granting cultural and local autonomy to the Armenian population of Nagorny-Karabakh , Armenia rejected the recommendations of the Committee of Senior Officials of the CSCE relating to the inviolability of the frontiers between Azerbaijan and Armenia .
Armenia considered that the only way of resolving the problem was the proclamation of an independent Nagorny-Karabakh .
39 . On behalf of the Azeri Government , he assured the Sub-Commission that Azerbaijan , which desired a peaceful solution to the conflict , was ready to grant cultural and local autonomy to the Armenians living in Nagorny-Karabakh , whose security would be guaranteed .
The meeting rose at l.05 p.m.
Editor &apos;s note . The statement by Ms. Smith ( Four Directions Council ) on agenda item 6 appears in the summary record of the 14th meeting which covers that item .

The meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.
ORGANIZATION OF WORK ( continued )
1 . The CHAIRMAN suggested that , since delegations might wish to participate in the deliberations currently taking place in the Commission on Human Rights , which was meeting in special session , they should be given the floor when it was convenient for them .
2 . It was so agreed .
3 . Mrs. KSENTINI described the unpleasant experience she had had that morning when crossing the border between France and Switzerland , an experience that was illustrative of the situation in which nationals of third world countries might find themselves when they crossed the borders the Western countries .
After one look at her face and Algerian passport , a customs officer had made her get off the bus with no explanation although she had shown papers that were perfectly in order , including a diplomatic passport exempting her from a visa , together with her Sub-Commission membership card .
The senior customs officer , to whom she had complained , acknowledged their mistake : they had thought she needed a visa .
4 . The incident gave rise to a discussion in which Mrs. WARZAZI and Mr. MAXIM , who had themselves been victims of similar incidents on previous occasions , Mr. SABOIA , Mrs. ATTAH , Mr. JOINET , Mr. SACHAR , Mr. UL- HAKIM , Mr. TIAM JIN , Mr. GUISSE , Mr. EIDE , Mr. RAMADHANE and Mr. KHALIFA took part , indicating their shock and indignation at the increasing number of incidents that were indicative of racial sentiments , all the more outrageous because they were directed against the members of a body entrusted with combating discrimination and therefore doubly deserving of respect .
They demanded explanations and an official apology from the Swiss authorities and asked once again that a document serving as a visa , like the one issued to Mr. Mazilu , should be issued to them to protect them from similar unpleasantness and humiliation .
They expressed surprise that the issuance of such a document raised so many difficulties when one saw how easily certain persons could obtain one .
That was a very disturbing question which should be settled quickly , for such incidents wasted the Sub-Commission &apos;s time .
The Under-Secretary-General for Human Rights and a representative of the Swiss authorities should come before the Sub-Commission to provide it with explanations .
5 . Mr. JOINET said he believed the least that could be expected was for the competent Swiss authorities to apologize .
Two members of the Sub-Commission should go to the Customs Service to explain that its attitude was unacceptable given the very name of the Sub-Commission .
Regarding immunities and privileges , he referred the experts to the report of the Inter-Sessional Working Group ( E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 3 ) , in which the Working Group requested page that , to strengthen the experts &apos; independence , they should be issued a United Nations certificate attesting their status as &quot; experts on mission &quot; .
The members of the Committee on the Rights of the Child had such a certificate ; why should the members of the Sub-Commission not also have one ?
He proposed that a memorandum should be sent to the Under-Secretary-General for Human Rights requesting a positive response at the current session , which implied that the Under-Secretary-General would attend the discussion on agenda item 3 .
6 . The CHAIRMAN said that there were two aspects to the situation : the personal offence against the expert as an individual and the offence against the institution to which the expert belonged .
He was prepared to contact the Under-Secretary-General for Human Rights immediately to inform him of the incident and proposed that when the Under-Secretary-General came , the members of the Sub-Commission should tell him of their concern and stress the need to ask the Swiss authorities to conduct an inquiry and apologize to Mrs. Ksentini and the Sub-Commission .
It would also be advisable for the legal representative of the Secretariat to inform the Sub-Commission about the substance of the discussions that had taken place with the Swiss Government concerning the issuance of a document to protect them against that type of unpleasantness .
7 . Mrs. WARZAZI said that the document which the members of the Sub-Commission needed had to be issued by the United Nations Secretariat , not the Swiss authorities .
Furthermore , if such an incident recurred , the Sub-Commission should inform the media to give it the publicity it deserved .
8 . The CHAIRMAN explained that reference was being made to two different documents , one issued by the United Nations Secretariat and not involving any consultations with the Swiss authorities , and the other , issued by the Swiss authorities , concerning which discussions had been held .
The latter document , moreover , would only provide extra protection against lack of understanding by the Swiss Customs Service .
Thus there was no contradiction between his proposal and Mrs. Warzazi &apos;s remarks .
9 . Mr. MAXIM proposed that the Sub-Commission should request a certificate from the United Nations Secretariat only .
That document could indeed be provided by the Protocol Service and would be sufficient for the members of the Sub-Commission .
He would like to know why the Legal Service should not issue it to experts at once .
10 . The CHAIRMAN noted that the members agreed that Mr. Blanca should be informed of the incident and its seriousness in their opinion and asked to contact the Swiss authorities in order for the necessary measures to be taken , including the appropriate apologies .
QUESTION OF THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS , INCLUDING POLICIES OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND SEGREGATION AND OF APARTHEID , IN ALL COUNTRIES , WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO COLONIAL AND OTHER DEPENDENT COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES : REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMISSION UNDER COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTION 8 ( XXIII ) ( agenda item 6 ) ( continued ) ( E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 13 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 14 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 39 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 40 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 41 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1993 / 3-E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 42 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1993 / 5-E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 43 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 45 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 47 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / NGO / 4 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / NGO / 6 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / NGO / 8 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / NGO / 13 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / NGO / 14 )
11 . The CHAIRMAN , taking up agenda item 6 , recalled that , in resolution 1991 / 8 on the situation in Cambodia the previous year , the Sub-Commission had called upon the Secretary-General to dispatch without delay , to all the provinces of Cambodia and to the refugee camps located in Thailand , a special mission to examine the situation of the population with regard to respect for human rights .
He invited Mr. McNamara , who was in charge of the Human Rights Component of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia ( UNTAC ) to describe , in the context of agenda item 6 , UNTAC &apos;s human rights activities in Cambodia .
12 . Mr. McNAMARA said that , in conformity with the Sub-Commission &apos;s request in its resolution 1991 / 8 , namely that the teaching of human rights to the whole population of Cambodia should be organized forthwith , through appropriate channels , UNTAC was currently undertaking various programmes for raising awareness of human rights and fundamental freedoms , aimed at all levels of society , including illiterate people , by using radio and television .
UNTAC also reviewed legislation , court procedures and prison conditions .
Its mandate enabled it to receive complaints from persons who felt that their rights had been violated , to investigate the allegations and where necessary to take action to end the violations .
The numerous complaints before it ( over 200 to date ) permitted UNTAC to identify the problem areas and design corresponding measures for improvement .
13 . All those activities were aimed at creating conditions that would prevent the return of the policies and practices of the past and at achieving a minimum level of respect for human rights throughout the country , a sine qua non for the holding of free and fair elections , supervised by the United Nations , in May 1993 .
It had become clear that standard approaches for the improvement of human rights enjoyment did not apply in Cambodia .
The country lacked a basic legal infrastructure .
More than 20 years of conflict had left Cambodia virtually without lawyers , judges , legal institutions or human rights groups .
Thus there was a need for the rehabilitation , indeed installation , of the legal and judicial systems to be undertaken in parallel with human rights advocacy programmes .
To transform Cambodia from conflict to reconciliation and from military rule to a society under the rule of law was an immense undertaking .
It was clear that promotion and protection of human rights were instrumental to the success of that transition .
But to do so within a year with limited resources in a country lacking basic infrastructures and expertise was a monumental challenge .
Thus UNTAC hoped that all interested organizations , including the Centre for Human Rights and the non-governmental organizations , would become actively involved in improving the human rights situation in Cambodia .
14 . The international community had a special responsibility to ensure that the current momentum was maintained and that institutions and programmes put in place by UNTAC were continued after the expiry of its mandate .
The same was valid for education , infrastructural reform , review of legislation , human rights monitoring and the encouragement of indigenous NGOs .
In that context , UNTAC was planning to convene an international symposium on human rights in Phnom Penh in December 1992 with a view to drawing the international community &apos;s attention to the situation in Cambodia .
15 . UNTAC &apos;s human rights mandate was the broadest ever entrusted to any United Nations peace-keeping operation .
UNTAC was empowered fully to investigate complaints , to propose legal and judicial reform , to review prison conditions and grounds for detention and to launch mass public human rights information and education programmes .
The Cambodian operation could generate important lessons for the future direction of human rights activities .
Cambodia was a human rights challenge that the international community , and especially the United Nations , could not afford to fail .
16 . Mr. GUISSE said that he did not share Mr. Bossuyt &apos;s optimism concerning the situation of black people in South Africa .
The black population was still being deprived of its fundamental rights , in particular the right to vote , and black people were often the victims of unfair dismissals by the white minority , which controlled over 80 per cent of the country &apos;s economy .
On another matter , one could only deplore the concept of &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; currently being put into practice in the former Yugoslavia and which was a most unpleasant reminder of the concept of &quot; pure race &quot; used before the Second World War , and that of the separate development of the races .
States were not the only ones bound to ensure respect for human rights ; so were groups and individuals .
17 . Mr. MERRILLS said that the search for solutions might be facilitated by classifying human rights violations in two major categories .
The first category contained conflicts between a Government and a segment of its people .
In those cases , the solution lay in finding a political accommodation between the elements in society which were in conflict , and at that stage human rights institutions had only a limited part to play .
However , if the conflict took on the proportions of a civil war , human rights institutions should remind the parties in conflict that there were certain rights that were not subject to derogation , such as the right not to be tortured .
He noted in that connection that Mr. Eide , in cooperation with other persons , had prepared a document entitled &quot; the Turku Declaration &quot; , which suggested codification and development of that part of humanitarian law .
18 . The second category concerned situations of general repudiation of democratic values by an authoritarian Government , military or other .
In such cases the Sub-Commission &apos;s task was to examine the extent to which the Government in question was respecting general human rights standards as set forth in the international instruments and fulfilling obligations deriving from international customary law .
In conclusion , he stressed the need for both States and individuals to live in the present and look towards the future , not to keep turning over the sometimes painful experiences of the past but to learn from them for the purpose of building a better world .
19 . Mrs. FORERO UCROS said that the end of the East-West conflict had raised hopes for a new international order based on democracy and respect for fundamental freedoms .
Instead , the world was witnessing a resurgence of racism and an increase in inequality and the havoc caused by ethnonationalism , which trampled human rights underfoot .
Regarding respect for human rights , to be objective the international community should not only remind States of their responsibilities ; it should also condemn terrorist groups which terrorized the civilian population , destroyed infrastructures and national heritages and hindered development .
It should also help countries to combat drug traffickers at all levels , whether that of production , manufacture , traffic , consumption or laundering of the money made from the traffic .
20 . Such violence was due to poverty and social inequality , which in the developing countries prohibited the exercise of human rights and stood in the way of strengthening democracy .
The development of those countries was greatly hindered by protectionist barriers , the debt burden , and the requirements of the international financial institutions .
In order to end the violence , their Governments ought to ensure respect for justice , prohibit any form of paramilitarism , set up effective mechanisms for protecting human rights and monitor their agents &apos; actions effectively .
Obviously the United Nations also had a fundamental part to play : it should in particular prevent conflicts , including those caused by ethnonationalism , publicize human rights and train the State officials entrusted with enforcing them .
21 . Mr. KHALIFA deplored the fact that the end of the cold war and the break-up of the Soviet Union , far from meeting the hopes raised , had opened the way to so many atrocities and such large-scale violations of human rights .
The world was currently in a situation of rebellion by minorities , attacks on the overriding principle of national sovereignty , the resurgence of the extreme right and racism and the marginalization of a third world which in fact no longer fitted that description .
22 . It was deeply disturbing to see that violence had become intertwined daily life : in politics , the press , the street , entertainment , television , even music .
Thus in a recent recording , a rock group glorified &quot; the killing of cops &quot; .
Serbia , which had inherited the former Yugoslavia &apos;s military might , was openly applying that theory to forge a Greater Serbia at the expense of Bosnia and planning to do the same in Kosovo .
Croatia , for its part , was encouraging the Croatians in Bosnia to proclaim their own independent republic .
Bosnia , the victim of aggression , was being carved up because it had no rich neighbours or oil and could not pay the cost of its liberation .
The major Powers were only concerning themselves with stopping the fighting and providing humanitarian aid .
It might be wondered who would hold the Serbs in check once peace was re-established .
Where were the 38 States that had mobilized an armada to throw Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait ?
In Bosnia , because of Realpolitik , it was not a question of aggression but of humanitarian aid .
Only the naive had ever considered the liberation of Kuwait as a prototype .
23 . The United Nations was once again in the forefront .
It was again being called on in the Bosnian crisis , but the United States , so eager to become involved in the Gulf crisis , was insisting that its intervention should be limited to humanitarian aid .
It probably feared - rightly so - becoming bogged down in a difficult situation at a time when it needed to devote all its resources and all its energy to improving its domestic situation .
In the circumstances , a warning was in order : the United Nations was based on the sovereignty of its States Members .
If that sovereignty began to be eroded , the sovereignty of the United Nations would be affected .
The United Nations must be kept credible and must remain an authentically international organization , for the world could not tolerate what in his view was a de facto privatization of the Organization .
24 . However , he feared that in view of the - quite genuine - suffering it was witnessing , the international community would gradually accept the concept of humanitarian intervention .
Some held that there was a need to reassess the prevailing view of national sovereignty that might have contributed to recent disasters .
General Assembly resolutions 44 / 129 and 44 / 155 marked a significant step in that direction .
Although the wording of those resolutions was vague and equivocal , he hoped that the General Assembly would not take further steps in a direction that appeared to him to be very perilous .
There was no clear-cut line between humanitarian intervention and outright intervention .
However , whether interventionism was practised individually or collectively , it would have to be selective .
On the one hand it was costly , and on the other there would be times when the political will was lacking .
In any event , the United States , which was assuming a forceful leadership role , would one day have to abandon that role , which its economy could not tolerate for long .
25 . The interventionist spirit and disdain for the sacred principle of State sovereignty went hand in hand with the awakening of the extreme right .
Communism had scarcely crumbled when fascism and neo-Nazism , and the populist movements that went with them , began to be revived .
The recent elections in France , Germany and even Scandinavia , which might have been thought to be spared such phenomena , showed that nationalist and xenophobic parties gained considerable ground in a context of economic recession .
26 . In the words of Oscar Arias Sanchez , Nobel Peace Prize laureate , could poor people be stopped at national borders , or , more precisely , could poverty be stopped from travelling - in the form of drug addiction , pollution , terrorism and AIDS ?
It could not ; the fate of the haves and the have-nots was inextricably intertwined .
He referred to the poverty that was looming large in the highly industrialized nations , unable to provide for their increasing numbers of poor , not to speak of the extreme poverty of the rest of the world , whether in eastern Europe or the countries of the third world .
The latter too often tried to emulate the Western model , flirting ineffectually with the free market , criminality , prostitution and drugs . Was that the price of freedom ?
He quoted Lech Walesa , who had recently accused the West of betraying his nation by deluging it with consumer goods but refusing to make major investments .
He did not wish to predict an Armageddon , but patience definitely had an end .
27 . Mr. Sachar took the Chair .
28 . Mr. VITTORI ( Pax Christi International ) said he deeply regretted the incident that had befallen Mrs. Ksentini and said that he would ask the Swiss section of his organization to intervene with the Swiss authorities .
29 . He drew a parallel between the Nazi concentration camps and the current attempts at &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; and expressed surprise at the behaviour of the international community in that respect .
The special session of the Commission on Human Rights should propose genuinely effective measures .
The dismantling of the concentration camps have a top priority , and should be accompanied by measures for resettling the displaced populations and dispatching international humanitarian aid .
Such measures implied a firm political will and the bringing to bear of appropriate pressure , among which Pax Christi advocated non-violent action .
30 . He hoped that the embargo imposed on Yugoslavia would be turned into a selective blockade ; why should aggressors and victims be treated on an equal footing ?
Radio and television in the democratic countries should alert the people , especially the Serbs , to what was being done in their name and make the voice of reason heard in order to end the atrocities .
The attention of those concerned should also be drawn to the penalties prescribed for crimes against humanity , to which not only those ordering the crimes but those carrying them out were liable .
He suggested that Mr. Guissé and Mr. Joinet should deal with that question in their work on impunity .
He believed that a campaign of passive resistance and conscientious objection - without prejudice to other measures - could also influence the Serbian people .
31 . The situation in Yugoslavia should not distract from other equally difficult situations .
The famine in Somalia , for example , should mobilize the international community on an emergency basis .
Pax Christi noted that during the cold war , military expenditures had been as high as $ 2 million per minute , and was astonished that the funds needed for saving human beings from the famine could not be found .
The famine , although it was partially attributable to the drought , could also be attributed to the war being waged by the three rival factions in Somalia .
He called on the United Nations to restore peace .
A similar mission would also be needed in Sri Lanka , Afghanistan , Kurdistan , Liberia and Sudan , Rwanda and Western Sahara .
Pax Christi strongly criticized the behaviour of the wealthy countries , which was more willing to make sacrifices for their military expenditures than for the genuine promotion of peace and justice .
32 . Pax Christi wished to refer to the violation of United Nations decisions with regard to Timor , Tibet , Burma , and the Israeli-occupied territories .
It deplored the embargo against Haiti and denounced the military training taking place in a camp in Sudan , with the financial assistance of Iran .
33 . In conclusion , Pax Christi quoted the Secretary-General of the United Nations in recalling the primary purposes of the Charter of the United Nations , namely a United Nations capable of maintaining international peace and security , ensuring justice and respect for human rights .
34 . Mr. AL-JADIR ( Arab Organization for Human Rights ) said that his organization had published the previous month its annual report on the human rights situation in the Arab countries .
Regarding Palestine , negotiations had begun with a view to reaching a peaceful settlement and enabling the Palestinians to obtain autonomy , but no reference had been made to self-determination or the right of return , which were fundamental rights .
Israel had pursued its policy of settling the occupied territories and continued to kill Palestinians who opposed the occupation .
Nevertheless , Israeli television had for the first time shown in action the secret units , who were responsible for the deaths of many Palestinians involved in the intifada .
Arrests had also continued : 8,525 arrests had been made since the beginning of the intifada until November 1991 , according to a spokesman for the Israeli army .
Another practice persisted : that of deliberately breaking the bones of persons arrested ; 65,000 such cases had been recorded from the beginning of the intifada until October 1991 .
35 . The occupying authorities continued to violate the right to freedom of expression , as attested by the closing of four information organs followed by that of a press service and a press agency on 20 February .
The journalist Tarek Shurtaih , a correspondent for the Reuter Agency , had also been arrested .
Finally , during the Gulf war , the Israeli authorities had prohibited journalists from travelling to the occupied territories , which were declared to be &quot; prohibited military areas &quot; from 17 January up to late April 1991 .
36 . Restrictions on the right to enter and leave the occupied territories had increased in 1991 .
The number of expulsions had also increased .
On 7 January 1991 , four Palestinians had been expelled from the Gaza Strip followed by four more on 18 May .
The Israeli authorities had also prohibited some 5,000 Palestinians who had left Kuwait during the Gulf crisis from re-entering the occupied territories , despite their being in possession of documents authorizing them to live there .
37 . Concerning Iraq , on 5 April 1991 the Security Council had adopted resolution 688 ( 1991 ) in which it had condemned the repression of the Iraqi civilian population , demanded that Iraq immediately end that repression and appealed to all humanitarian organizations to contribute to the humanitarian relief efforts .
However , that resolution had gone unheeded , and neither the Iraqi totalitarian Government nor the Security Council had given effect to it .
He hoped that the Sub-Commission would give that resolution the attention it deserved .
38 . Concerning the famine raging in the Horn of Africa , the political disturbances in that part of Africa were hindering the international community &apos;s effort .
In Sudan , the relief operations were making slow progress .
The situation was all the more complicated because some 400,000 Sudanese refugees who had been in camps in Ethiopia had had to settle in the border and swamp zones controlled by the Sudanese People &apos;s Liberation Army .
In Somalia , famine compounded the already disastrous human rights situation in that country , torn by armed conflicts .
According to all reports , the population suffered from lack of food and medical care .
Once again , the children were the worst affected .
What was more , relief teams faced virtually unsurmountable difficulties .
39 . The Gulf war had brought out the problem of persons who had been born in Kuwait and lived there all their lives but did not have Kuwaiti nationality .
The problem of the &quot; bidouns &quot; reflected a gap in the Kuwaiti Nationality Code of 1959 , which divided the Kuwaiti population into several categories at the political , social and economic levels , in flagrant violation of human rights principles .
The problem went back to the period of independence , when the Government had established several committees to consider applications for naturalization and check applicants &apos; identities .
Some applications had been accepted ; others had been rejected for lack of sufficient proof .
He urged the Sub-Commission to consider that problem in the light of recent events in Kuwait .
40 . Mr. RODRIGUEZ ( Andean Commission of Jurists ) said that the existence of constitutional regimes in the Andean countries - with the exception of Peru - could lead one to think that the political conditions of the previous decades , which had produced grave violations of human rights , no longer prevailed .
However , the construction of authentic democracies in those countries had not been achieved , due to the inadequacy of their institutions .
The administration of justice was the weakest link in the chain , because of its inability to process the conflicts generated by the social and economic crises which to one degree of another affected the Andean countries .
41 . Since 1988 , 10 people a day had been killed in Colombia for ideological reasons : 5 for political reasons , 4 in the war between the army and guerrilla groups and 1 in &quot; social clean-up &quot; operations .
Similarly , a person &quot; disappeared &quot; every two days .
In the first six months of 1992 , 1,863 people had been killed in such situations .
Where the author or motive had been identified , 40 per cent of the cases were attributed to State agents , 30 per cent to paramilitary groups and 27.5 per cent to the guerrilla .
Drug traffickers were considered to be the material authors in only 0.18 per cent of known cases .
In 1991 , 3,700 people had been murdered as a result of political or ideological violence ; that figure represented 13 per cent of all homicides .
Those human rights violations were taking place at a time when the evolution of democracy stemming from the 1991 Constitution was facing serious difficulties .
A state of emergency had already been declared on two occasions in 1992 , and the Government had proposed a new law on states of emergency that was characterized by restrictions of civil liberties and the usurping of legislative and judicial powers by the executive .
In July habeas corpus had been suspended for cases of drug trafficking and terrorism , and the Government was seeking to make that derogation a permanent measure .
During 35 of the 42 years between 1949 and 1991 , Colombia had been governed , and continued to be governed , by states of emergency .
The human rights situation had again worsened in May with the suspension of talks between the Government and the guerrilla .
Seven hundred and eighty Colombians had died in the armed conflict in the first six months of 1992 .
Moreover , the policy of reduced sentences for drug trafficking was being seriously questioned since the escape from jail on 22 July of the drug trafficker Paulo Escobar .
That strategy , which had been aimed at introducing a more civilized approach to the treatment of drug traffickers , had not always been properly employed and had involved high levels of corruption and inefficiency .
42 . That critical human rights situation deserved attention from the Sub-Commission .
Colombia had received advisory services from the Centre for Human Rights which had been important but were insufficient to deal with the magnitude of generalized disrespect for human rights in the country .
Increased United Nations assistance for Colombia indispensable .
Such assistance might help to consolidate the constitutional process and simplify the implementation of the recommendations made to the Colombian Government by the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances , particularly with respect to the need to avoid abusing emergency powers and to remove from service all State agents involved in human rights violations .
43 . In Peru , political violence had led to 35,000 deaths since 1980 .
Enforced disappearances continued unabated : in 1991 , 395 disappearances had been reported , and there had been 113 in the first six months of 1992 .
With respect to extrajudicial executions , between August 1991 and July 1992 there had been 85 executions attributed to the security forces and 34 to paramilitary groups .
During that period , the Shining Path had murdered close to 800 people .
Those human rights violations were aggravated by the climate of social conflict and restrictions on democracy due to the 5 April coup d &apos;état , which limited even more the possibility of denouncing , investigating and sanctioning those crimes .
The current regime had found no effective ways to deal with terrorism , and had paid attention to its effects rather than its causes .
Impunity continued to generate violence .
Neither the atrocities committed by the subversive movements nor the human rights violations committed by the security forces had been sanctioned .
Judges were constantly threatened when they tried members of subversive groups ; the members of the security forces accused of violating human rights went unpunished , and in any event should be tried in the ordinary courts .
Additionally , the autonomy of the judicial branch had been dealt a severe blow after the coup d &apos;état and the decision to try persons accused of terrorism in the military courts , which was far from facilitating human rights protection .
44 . Mrs. AMIR ( Women &apos;s International League for Peace and Freedom ) drew the attention of the Sub-Commission to the systematic violations of human rights , especially women &apos;s rights , in Iran .
With the advent of the Islamic Republic in 1979 , Iranian women had been reduced to second-class citizens .
They had been deprived of all the constitutional rights that had been granted to them under the Shah , through the Family Protection Law which had banned polygamy and conferred on women the rights and have custody of their children .
The repeal of the Family Protection Law had resulted in the re-establishment of men &apos;s unilateral right and the increased dependence of women on their husbands .
The Islamic laws also banned women from entering certain professions and pursuing studies in certain spheres , especially technical and scientific fields , and agriculture .
The entire educational system had been Islamicized in order to create obstacles to women &apos;s education .
Over 40,000 women elementary and high school teachers had been dismissed within the first few years of the establishment of the Islamic Republic .
The lack of female teachers had resulted in the closure of many schools for girls , since schools were not mixed , so that at least 89 per cent of Iranian rural women were illiterate .
Public displays of women &apos;s sports were subject to severe punishment and women were segregated from men in public transportation systems .
45 . Harassment of women who did not comply with the Islamic code of dress , or Hejab , had become commonplace .
In the past few months , hundreds of women had been flogged for that reason .
Some of them had even died during the flogging , and in June 1991 several women had been shot by revolutionary guards for protesting against the code .
She cited the case of 19-year-old Parivash Ameri , arrested by the revolutionary guards because she had not been dressed in accordance with the Islamic dress code , who had died as a result of torture .
In Iranian prisons , women prisoners accused of being opposed to the regime were raped , especially virgin girls , since according to the Islamic principle , only virgins went to heaven when they died .
The regime-controlled media were dominated by reports of arrests , flogging and heavy fines imposed on women accused of not observing the Hejab .
Such punishments were not considered excessive since , as the Prosecutor-General of Iran had stated on 15 August 1991 , &quot; Anyone who rejects the principle of the Hejab is an apostate and the punishment for an apostate under Islamic law is death &quot; .
It was absolutely essential for all human rights bodies , especially the Sub-Commission , to concern themselves with that situation and act to end the gross and systematic violations of human rights under the theocracy in Iran .
46 . Mr. COE ( National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services Secretariat ) noted that the right of all peoples to self-determination appeared in the first articles of the Charter of the United Nations and the International Covenants on Human Rights and had come to be regarded under international law as a fundamental human right .
However , there were still peoples who could not exercise that right and who were not in control of their own destiny .
That was the case of the Australian Aboriginal people , dispossessed of their land by the whites , who had used the doctrine of terra nullius to legitimize their usurpation of the territory .
That controversial question had again been mentioned in a recent decision by the High Court of Australia in the case of Mabo v. the State of Queensland , in which residents of the Murray Islands in the Torres Strait , which had been annexed by the colony of Queensland in 1879 , had claimed property rights over specified parcels of land on the Murray Islands , rejecting the defence argument that the rights of the plaintiffs , if they had ever existed , had been extinguished at the time of annexation .
The Court , with one judge dissenting , had held that Australian common law recognized the entitlement of indigenous peoples to their land , where that right was not extinguished .
In so doing , the High Court had officially rejected the doctrine of terra nullius and thus the fiction that the British had settled on land that belonged to no one .
However , the High Court had then simply replaced that notion with another equally racist one , the &quot; discovery &quot; doctrine , which gave exclusive title to a land to those who had discovered it .
Those two doctrines were essentially the same in character and had the same invidious effect on indigenous people in Australia .
The High Court judgement proclaimed the validity of Aboriginal title to the land but also confirmed the power of Governments to extinguish that title at any time by an act of State .
Furthermore , since no right to compensation arose from the extinction of the title , there was no further recourse for the dispossessed owner against what was basically legalized land theft .
47 . Thus the High Court judgement had in no way helped to change the Aboriginals &apos; status or promote their civil and political rights as set forth in the Covenant , to which Australia was committed by its ratification .
Twenty-five years after it had been decided that Aboriginal people were not fauna but a people with collective and individual rights , the wheel appeared to have turned full circle .
It was to be hoped that any future inquiry into such fundamental issues would not be left in the hands of those who were attempting to suppress Aboriginal voices in the international community and who denied Aboriginal people their right to self-determination .
48 . Mrs. SMITH ( Four Directions Council ) drew the attention of the Sub-Commission to the situation of Navajo families in the United States , who were being relocated into urban areas under a decision taken by the Congress in 1974 .
Millions of dollars had been spent on implementing that policy , but very little of the money had gone to help those families who had accepted the relocation .
Thus 93 families , or 405 people , had been relocated to Winslow , Arizona , where they were living in very difficult conditions because of high property taxes and utility bills .
Nothing was being done to help them .
The Navajos were not eligible for municipal loans , were not permitted to keep livestock and could not practise their religion without permission from the mayor .
Economic , social , cultural and poverty pressures had caused much mental and psychological disturbance and family problems , which had led to sharp increases in heart attacks , suicides , drug addiction and alcoholism .
Children had lost all respect for their parents and their cultural and religious traditions .
The Navajos were also the victims of direct or indirect discrimination in other fields , especially access to public schools and to support services and recreational activities for senior citizens and county and city services .
They were gradually losing their cultural pride , sense of roots and philosophy of life .
49 . Mrs. PARAKH ( International Commission of Jurists ) said that the International Commission of Jurists ( ICJ ) was greatly concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation in several parts of the world , especially the breakdown of the rule of law , frequently caused by military intervention in the normal life of a civil society .
50 . In Peru , President Fujimori &apos;s coup d &apos;état of 5 April 1992 had placed the entire country under the control of the military .
The coup d &apos;état had been an act of aggression against the very basis of the rule of law and an outrage to democracy .
For more than 12 years , Peru had been the constant victim of attacks by two guerrilla groups , Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement , which were responsible for numerous acts of aggression , but the brutal repression brought to bear by the armed forces and the police , not only against the members of those groups but all those suspected of viewing them with sympathy , had certainly not improved matters .
A dictatorship based on brutal force might well have a negative effect on the enforcement of human rights and on the democratic system in Peru .
The International Commission of Jurists therefore called for the appointment of a special rapporteur on Peru .
51 . The demonstrations that had taken place in the capital of Thailand in May 1992 , during which troops had shot at unarmed citizens protesting against the appointment as Prime Minister of General Suchinda Kraprayoon , a member of the military junta which had taken power after a coup d &apos;état on 23 February 1991 , had resulted in 52 deaths and 789 wounded , according to figures obtained by an ICJ mission to the country .
It was also estimated that 500 persons had disappeared .
Since then , a constitutional tribunal had declared legal the amnesty granted by General Suchinda before resigning on 24 May 1992 to all those involved in the massacre , and while some senior military leaders had been demoted , most of those responsible for the massacre had not been brought to justice .
Several commissions had been set up to inquire into the events of May 1992 , but they could not be effective if they did not have adequate powers , in particular the power to recommend and direct prosecutions if such prosecutions were found desirable in the public interest .
52 . The National Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Indonesian Government to investigate the events that had occurred on 12 November 1991 in Dili , East Timor , when the Indonesian Army had killed more than 50 unarmed civilians , had concluded in its advance report that the security forces had been responsible ; however , the few members of the military tried had simply been charged with &quot; disobeying orders &quot; and had received sentences from 8 to 18 months in prison , whereas the Timorese prosecuted for their role in the Dili demonstration and a subsequent one in Jakarta on 19 November had been charged with violating Indonesia &apos;s Anti-Subversion Law , which was a capital offence , or with spreading hatred towards the Government , and had been sentenced to prison terms of 5 years to life imprisonment in the Dili incident and 6 months to 10 years in the Jakarta incident .
Those trials had served to highlight the flaws inherent in the Indonesian Code of Criminal Procedure , which did not grant defendants the right to remain silent and compelled them to testify in their own trials .
Thus , the ICJ believed that the very existence of the Anti-Subversion Law of 1963 and the inadequate provisions of the Penal Code represented a serious violation of basic human rights .
53 . In Rwanda , violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms continued despite the fact that the Rwandese Government had recently ratified nine international human rights instruments .
Most blatant was the discrimination against members of the Tutsi minority , victims of extrajudicial killings by the security forces and of rape , torture , and arbitrary arrest and detention .
The Government also continued to harass political opponents and journalists who criticized it and failed to punish persons guilty of serious human rights violations , which indicated that its formal commitments to human rights were little more than rhetoric .
54 . Since 1988 , Colombia had also faced a situation of grave and persistent human rights violations .
In the first six months of 1992 , 1,863 people had been killed for political reasons or had died in combat .
Those responsible had been , respectively , State agents ( 40 per cent of cases ) , paramilitary groups ( 30 per cent ) , guerrilla movements ( 27.5 per cent ) and drug traffickers ( 18 per cent ) .
In addition , the remedy of habeas corpus had been suspended for cases of drug trafficking and terrorism .
That critical situation required the Sub-Commission &apos;s attention , and the ICJ asked for the appointment of an expert to present a report to the Commission on Human Rights on the situation in Colombia .
55 . Finally , the ICJ was particularly concerned at the human rights situation in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel , especially the systematic use of torture in Israeli prisons and the increasing number of deaths in detention .
In November 1987 , Israel had legalized the use of &quot; moderate physical pressure &quot; to extract confessions from detainees , and , according to a study made in autumn 1991 by a West Bank affiliate of the ICJ , 85 per cent of detainees had been tortured in various ways , and there had been more than 22 cases of death in custody since 1987 .
56 . Mr. AL-DOURI ( Observer for Iraq ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , reminded the representatives of Amnesty International and the Arab Organization for Human Rights , who had mentioned Iraq in their statements , that Iraq had been at war with Iran from 1980 to 1988 and had again been subjected to a war in 1991 , and that those wars had inevitably had repercussions on the political , economic and social spheres .
In addition , for the last two years the Iraqi people had been subjected to much suffering because of the economic blockade imposed on his country by the international community .
Amnesty International &apos;s allegations concerning the execution of military personnel in Iraq were devoid of any truth .
Similarly , there was no discrimination against the population of the marshlands ; only bandits and criminals were sought and punished in that region .
It was true that persons were still reported disappeared , but every effort was being made to ascertain their fate .
His delegation would revert to the Special Rapporteur and the way in which he was discharging his mission , when the relevant agenda item was considered .
He was in fact surprised that the representative of the Arab Organization for Human Rights , whose Chairman was not only an Arab but an Iraqi , did not protest against the tragic situation in which thousands of Iraqis found themselves through the sole will of the United States .
In conclusion , he advised the non-governmental organizations in question to check their sources of information before making accusations that were not supported by any proof .
Text submitted by the Sub-Commission to the Commission on Human Rights on the situation in the former Yugoslavia
57 . Mr. EIDE said that , following consultations among the members of the Sub-Commission , a text on the situation in the former Yugoslavia , intended for the Commission on Human Rights , which was currently holding a special session , had been prepared and distributed in the meeting room .
He read out the text , which was the following :
&quot; The Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , meeting at its forty-fourth session , noting the convening of the special session on the former Yugoslavia of the Commission on Human Rights , taking into account that the right to life and other fundamental human rights are being extensively violated in the former Yugoslavia and conscious that the protection of different ethnic groups is at the core of the mandate of the Sub-Commission ,
Expresses its horror at its total and unqualified condemnation of policies of so-called &apos; ethnic cleansing &apos; , which in the former Yugoslavia has generated vast displacements of people and large flows of refugees of the different ethnic groups , and in Bosnia and Herzegovina has affected , in particular , the Muslim population ;
Also expresses its deep concern at the existence of detention centres and allegations of serious human rights violations in those centres ;
Demands :
( a ) That steps be taken on an urgent basis to stop the massive violations of the right to life and other human rights ;
( b ) That the policies and practices of so-called &apos; ethnic cleansing &apos; be immediately brought to an end ;
( c ) That displaced people be given the opportunity to return to their homes and that their safety be ensured ;
( d ) That full reparation be made for losses suffered as a result of the displacement ;
( e ) That those responsible for the commission of crimes be brought to justice and that steps be taken as a matter of urgency to this end . &quot;
He hoped that the Sub-Commission would adopt the text .
58 . Mr. Alfonso Martinez resumed the Chair .
59 . The CHAIRMAN said that if there was no objection , he would take it that the Sub-Commission adopted the text on the situation in the former Yugoslavia just read out by Mr. Eide , which would be submitted to the Commission on Human Rights .
60 . The text on the situation in the former Yugoslavia was adopted .
61 . Mr. JOINET , supported by Mr. AL-KHASAWNEH and Mrs. KSENTINI , asked the Chairman to transmit the text to the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights as soon as possible .
62 . The CHAIRMAN assured the Sub-Commission that the text would be transmitted that very afternoon .
The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.

ORGANIZATION OF WORK ( continued )
1 . The CHAIRMAN informed the Sub-Commission that Mr. Blanca , Under-Secretary-General for Human Rights , had assured him that measures would be taken without delay in response to the incident of which Ms. Ksentini had been the victim so that all the experts of the Sub-Commission would in future be provided with a document attesting that they enjoyed diplomatic immunity .
2 . Mr. CISSE ( Secretariat ) confirmed that the Secretariat had made arrangements for issuing the attestation in question to all members of the Sub-Commission and to their alternates as soon as the latter had filled out the form produced for that purpose , which they should return as soon as possible together with two photographs .
3 . The CHAIRMAN thanked the Secretariat for its prompt response to the request of the Sub-Commission &apos;s members .
QUESTION OF THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS , INCLUDING POLICIES OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND SEGREGATION AND OF APARTHEID , IN ALL COUNTRIES , WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO COLONIAL AND OTHER DEPENDENT COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES : REPORT OF THE SUB-COMMISSION UNDER COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS RESOLUTION 8 ( XXIII ) ( agenda item 6 ) ( continued ) ( E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 13 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 14 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 39 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 40 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 41 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1993 / 3-E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 42 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1993 / 5-E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 43 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 45 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 47 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1993 / 6-E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 49 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 51 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / NGO / 4 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / NGO / 6 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / NGO / 8 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / NGO / 13 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / NGO / 14 ; E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / NGO / 19 )
4 . Mr. CHERNICHENKO said that it posed a dilemma to have to choose between a rapid review of human rights violations throughout the world and a more in-depth consideration of a number of particularly shocking situations .
At the risk of being accused of selectivity , he said that he preferred the latter approach .
He had already referred to the situation in Africa during the examination of other agenda items ; with regard to the human rights violations in the occupied Arab territories , he would confine himself to saying that they were unacceptable .
5 . He wished to speak at greater length on the situation in Russia .
While blood was being shed in the territories of the former Soviet Union , matters had not taken on the same proportions in Russia . Yet the situation there was hardly satisfactory , given the very serious social and economic difficulties that the country was experiencing .
One non-governmental organization had already referred to a number of trouble spots that might well result in to human rights violations .
7 . Although it was sometimes difficult to distinguish between political questions and purely humanitarian ones , he agreed with Mr. Eide that , in cases of intervention for humanitarian reasons , it was of the utmost importance not to modify the territorial status of the regions in question .
A balance must be struck between the inviolability of territorial integrity and the right of peoples to self-determination .
8 . He then turned to another alarming situation , in the Baltic States .
In Latvia and Estonia , the Russian-speaking population was the target of discrimination ; the authorities had not even attempted to deny it and had stripped many persons of their citizenship .
In Estonia , they had even envisaged requiring the licence plates of Russian speakers to be a particular colour , yellow : that evoked unpleasant memories .
The idea had , however , been rejected .
In Lithuania , although the situation was much less alarming , it was regrettable that the decision had been taken to pull down the statue of Pushkin , whose only offence was to have been a great Russian poet who had been held in esteem by his Lithuanian friends .
9 . He wondered whether the Sub-Commission should not examine potentially explosive situations more closely and even take preventive measures in certain cases .
He proposed studying the question more thoroughly under agenda item 3 .
He was also very concerned about the situation in Iran . Although basically hostile to the principle of adopting a resolution in cases in which the Commission on Human Rights was considering a specific situation , he believed that it might perhaps be necessary to envisage doing so for Iran .
The problem of the Kurds had become particularly serious in that country .
Concerning the Kurds , Iraq had been the State most implicated in the past , but Turkey had increasingly been replacing Iraq in that unflattering role .
He was surprised that Turkey should be so interested in the situation in Nagorny Karabakh and in the former Yugoslavia , while ignoring the question of the Kurds within its own borders .
10 . Lastly , he would like the Sub-Commission to give close consideration to circumstances in which human rights violations were the acts of States themselves and to draft a report on that fundamental question of principle .
He drew attention to working paper E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 51 , of which he was the author , and expressed the hope that the members of the Sub-Commission would comment upon it .
11 . Ms. KSENTINI said that agenda item 6 provided an opportunity for a critical assessment of the work accomplished in the defence of human rights .
As the drafting of numerous international instruments and the setting up of many mechanisms and procedures had shown , progress had been made , but political interests and ideological quarrels had too frequently paralysed effectiveness .
The logic of human rights was all too often the victim of hypocritical attitudes that left the international community powerless to put an end to the most serious violations .
Moreover , those responsible were all too often assured of impunity , and in that context she referred to the apartheid regime in South Africa and Israel &apos;s policy in the occupied territories .
12 . She deplored the continuing dichotomy between individual and collective rights and between civil and political rights and economic rights .
She also regretted the inability of the international community to comprehend the external factors preventing the realization of all those rights .
Whereas progress had been made in achieving recognition of economic rights , few effective measures had been taken to ensure their implementation in practice , and for many , civil and political rights continued to be &quot; noble &quot; rights which must take precedence over others .
13 . Fostered by the collapse of communism , the ephemeral hope that an age of justice , progress and liberty was finally dawning had quickly faded , the bipolar world having given way to a unipolar system which imposed a sole model , conveyed by the media right into the homes of the third world , where an unshared prosperity could be viewed from afar .
Under the current unipolar system , the South was forgotten , while new prospects for investment opened up in eastern Europe .
She referred in that context to the famine in Somalia which , unbearable though it was , had attracted so little attention .
Furthermore , at a time when many African countries had undertaken courageous reforms , they were left to struggle with their economic problems , overwhelmed by the social costs of the structural readjustment forced upon them and the burden of their external debt .
She warned against underestimating the discontent of the segments of society that bore the brunt of the economic crisis in the poor countries .
Such contempt might well be a boon to extremist and fundamentalist parties that exploited the situation and used democracy to their own ends , which were certainly not democratic .
The danger was not confined to the South , because in an interdependent world , no country could remain in isolation .
14 . The world had lost its bearings , and the expectations of recent years had quickly died with the resurgence of nationalism , regionalism , sectarianism , racism , ethnocentricity and inter-ethnic violence .
Thus , at the very moment when certain States were speeding up their political and economic integration process , many others were disintegrating .
She wondered about the causes of the situation in Yugoslavia and the reasons that prevented the international community from taking firm action .
In view of that situation , which was so horrible that the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) had broken its usual silence to condemn what was currently happening in Bosnia and Herzegovina , she asked how it was possible not to take action to oppose the policy of ethnic cleansing , of which Muslims were the main target .
She condemned the forced displacement of populations and their replacement by settlers .
That was a common practice developed by colonial or occupying powers to modify the demographic composition of the regions concerned , and she referred in particular to the case of the territories occupied by Israel .
The multilateral negotiation process had not stopped the establishment of settlements in the occupied Arab territories .
It was also worth noting the decision announced by President Bush on 11 August that the United States Treasury would provide $ 10 billion in loan guarantees enabling Israel to borrow from private banks so as to finance the settlement of 400,000 Jewish immigrants ; meanwhile , the Palestinian population had been reduced to the status of refugees .
16 . More generally speaking , the situation of refugees was invariably the result of a denial of human rights , in particular the right to self-determination .
She cited in that regard the right to self-determination of the Sahrawi people and referred to the study by Saddrudin Aga Khan , former High Commissioner for Refugees , on the mass exodus of populations in the region concerned .
The problem there was one of unfinished decolonization , and she would have liked to see effective measures taken to implement the peace plan of the United Nations Secretary-General and to ensure that a referendum on the self-determination of the Sahrawi people was held under the auspices of the United Nations and in cooperation with the Organization of African Unity .
17 . Mr. SACHAR said that as the numerous statements made at the Sub-Commission , in particular by representatives of non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , had unfortunately shown , the basic right to life and liberty was still not guaranteed to all human beings .
At the beginning of the 1980s , the debate on human rights had often been a pretext for confrontations between the two world super-Powers , the West posing as the champion of civil and political rights , and the East maintaining that those rights could not be exercised as long as economic , social and cultural rights were not guaranteed .
The truth of the matter was that there was no contradiction between those two categories of rights , which were completely indissociable : the denial of either category inevitably had serious consequences .
The collapse of the USSR had shown that democracy and development always went hand in hand .
That did not mean , however , that civil and political rights were fully respected throughout the world .
The report of the Secretary-General ( E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 11 ) , which the Commission had considered under item 6 ( a ) of its agenda , had highlighted the resurgence of such phenomena as racism in the West , particularly in European countries , once considered models of tolerance and non-discrimination .
In democracies of long standing , such as the United Kingdom and France , a &quot; new racism &quot; had emerged based on cultural differences . Paradoxically , such a phenomenon had an anti-racist veneer , respectful of the identity of all groups , but that purported respect for cultural uniqueness disguised a hatred of others .
In those countries , nationalist arguments aimed in reality at consolidating the European identity .
18 . The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe had led to a reawakening of nationalism and a resurgence of anti-Semitism ( report of the Secretary-General , para . 14 ) .
In the United States and Russia , there had been an increase in racism and racist acts committed against minorities , and in the majority of European countries , racist or xenophobic sentiments were shared by an increasingly large percentage of the population ( paras . 21-23 ) .
That phenomenon had attained alarming proportions in Bosnia , where the current situation had rightly aroused the concern of the international community .
19 . Perhaps the international community should have reacted much more rapidly than had been the case to try and put an end to the sufferings of the population in Somalia .
The concept of human rights was universal , and the international community was duty-bound to take action wherever those rights were violated , be it in Europe , Africa or Asia .
20 . With regard to the item under consideration , the Sub-Commission traditionally assessed the situation of human rights in all countries , and it was clear that that approach must continue .
However , it might also attempt to determine to what extent the rich and powerful States , which profited from the misery and poverty of other countries , were responsible for violations of human rights around the world .
The same applied to countries which , under the guise of international tourism , encouraged the worst form of prostitution and slave trade with women in less-developed countries .
Many Western countries adopted a paternalistic attitude towards small countries of Africa and Asia beset by military conflicts : turning their backs on such countries , they argued that tribal struggles were at issue which were of no concern to them .
Yet those countries had not hesitated to support and arm Iraq , whose human rights record had been far from satisfactory .
The United States had even considered starting a military exchange and training programme with that country three months before the invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi forces in August 1990 .
As pointed out by the Swedish ombudsman for ethnic discrimination in an article published in the Bulletin of Human Rights ( 91 / 1 ) , that proved that Western business practices provided direct support for violations of human rights and were at the origin of the refugee problem in certain parts of the world and that the rich countries were responsible for the militarization of the third world and thus for the terrible armed conflicts and the resulting human rights violations there .
That was a strong indictment , but clearly each country must examine its conscience , even those that claimed to be championing human rights and that took pride in their activities in that area .
No country was above criticism .
If those countries really wished to see human rights triumph , they must display humility and must truly implement the principles set forth in the various relevant international instruments , thereby helping to make the world a better place .
21 . The international organizations , in particular the financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bank were also implicated in certain human rights violations , because their financing of development projects such as the plan to build a dam in the Narmada Valley in India would have dangerous consequences for the environment and the life of the inhabitants of that region , who would have to be resettled .
That problem was , of course , for India to settle , but it was worth considering whether the World Bank should not sometimes ignore its economic interests when they were not compatible with respect for human rights .
22 . In closing , he said that , like Mr. Chernichenko , he was deeply disturbed by the plan to take down the statue of Pushkin in Lithuania .
He had himself been shocked to see that the statue of Lenin had been destroyed in disregard for the role that Lenin had played in the country &apos;s history , which had not begun with the advent of a market economy in 1990 .
23 . Mr. TIAN Jin said that the world had entered a period of great uncertainty and turbulence .
Contrary to expectations , the end of the cold war had not brought peace , and political disintegration in certain regions had been followed by armed conflicts and bloodshed with very serious consequences .
The rise of nationalisms and racist tendencies had created a permanent threat to large numbers of foreigners in certain countries .
Hegemonic aspirations and power politics had assumed new forms .
The gap between the developed and the developing countries had not narrowed , and hundreds of millions of human beings still lived in need or in extreme poverty .
Many countries were facing problems caused by growing drug traffic , the spread of AIDS and the worsening environment .
The new world order designed in certain quarters in the West had met with a cold reception .
It was in that broader context that the question of human rights violations must be examined .
24 . More than 90 per cent of the allegations and accusations brought before the Sub-Commission against Governments every year were directed at developing countries .
Yet everyone knew that no country was perfect .
The grave problems of crime , the 3 to 4 million homeless counted every summer , street children , drug addiction , single-parent families and homosexuality were well known .
The United States was also the country with the world &apos;s highest ratio of persons in prison as a percentage of the total population .
It was therefore only natural that in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots many commentators in the United States and elsewhere had rightly pointed out that it was time for the United States to mind its own business instead of preaching to other countries .
When considering violations of human rights , it would be more objective not to leave out the situation in the developed countries .
25 . The United Nations currently had 179 Member States , and they were all historically , politically , economically , socially , culturally , geographically and demographically different .
It followed that there was no system , mechanism or model that could be applied to all , not to say imposed by some on others .
Some plants and flowers grew very well in certain regions but withered and died in others .
That simple truth must be borne in mind if human rights problems were to be addressed and resolved effectively .
26 . Mr. BOUTKEVITCH said that the wording of agenda item 6 was imprecise , and that had an impact on the effectiveness with which it was examined .
Firstly , violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms were the subject of virtually all items on the Sub-Commission &apos;s agenda , and during the discussion on agenda item 6 , speakers very often repeated what had already been said in connection with other items .
Such repetition eventually became tiresome and counter-productive .
The question of &quot; policies of racial discrimination and segregation and of apartheid &quot; in the wording of item 6 was included in an item on all violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms and therefore did not receive the special attention it deserved .
Moreover , as racial discrimination had many facets , the obligations imposed on States in that regard by the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination were very numerous , and he did not see how a thorough study on State compliance could be undertaken .
There were currently just as many manifestations of racism and racial discrimination in Europe as in Africa .
It was therefore necessary to provide a clearer definition of the purpose of item 6 , whose current wording suggested that in the final analysis it was only concerned with human rights violations committed in certain colonial and dependent territories .
27 . In order to examine the item with greater effectiveness , more concrete methods of analysis must be devised for the future .
Proposals had been made to classify human rights violations according to their degree of seriousness .
He wondered what criteria would be used to determine which violations were most serious and most dangerous and what place racial discrimination would occupy in a classification that did not exist under international law .
The problem might well be insoluble .
Classifying according to the applicable norms of international law would also prove to be too difficult and too time-consuming for the Sub-Commission , because all international human rights instruments entailed obligations for States , and therefore it would again be necessary to determine which obligations were the most important .
Ms. Chavez had proposed to classify violations according to whether they were committed by individuals , by agents of the State or by Governments .
That method had certain advantages , but in his view , State involvement in such violations was most serious of all , because States had certain obligations to respect , and violations committed by them had much graver consequences than the others .
It was also necessary to specify which State bodies were responsible at all levels of government .
The role of the legislative and judicial authorities was sometimes vital .
In particular , there was a need to verify whether the laws adopted by the legislative authorities of a given State were consistent with international human rights instruments .
It was at the legislative level that mechanisms for human rights protection were created , and it was there that the Sub-Commission could play a preventive role .
Consideration might also be given to the practice of judicial authorities , which could be partly responsible for human rights violations if they delayed procedures or pronounced unjust rulings that created dangerous precedents .
28 . The examination of violations committed by individuals could be undertaken in the framework of the consideration of violations attributable to the State and its bodies , because in such cases the State had not taken the measures necessary to protect the victims and thus had not complied with its obligations .
As to the examination of violations that were the work of organizations , that necessitated investigations on the illegal activities of certain groups , because criminal organizations and groups often had an international dimension , for example in the case of the slave trade , and the State was hardly in a position to suppress their activities .
29 . Concerning means of mass communication , he said that the media often conveyed the propaganda of the State , which used the media to pass off human rights violations as activities aimed instead at defending human rights or at combating terrorism .
It was fairly simple for a Government to present any claim by a citizen as a danger to public order .
In view of the questionable reliability of the media as a source of information , norms should be drafted for their use ; freedom to disseminate information was one matter , illegal propaganda that violated human rights was another .
The Sub-Commission should examine that difficult problem separately .
30 . He concluded by saying that it was essential to devise a system for examining agenda item 6 ; Mr. Chernichenko and himself had made proposals on that subject .
31 . Ms. WARZAZI said she was surprised that for the first time , Ms. Ksentini was taking an interest in the self-determination of what she had called the Sahrawi people , although the subject referred to was the violation of human rights of refugees .
In actual fact , preparations for the planned referendum were under way , and the United Nations Secretary-General had expressed satisfaction with the collaboration of Morocco in that operation .
Any interference with the referendum was exclusively due to the Polisario and the disagreements among its members , certain of them having decided of their own free will to return to their country , to the dismay of the members of the leading bodies of that movement who , in no hurry to lose the privileges and material advantages gained from the current situation , had accused those who returned to their country of engaging in propaganda .
Calls for such an investigation had been made to a number of NGOs for quite some time , but there had been no response .
In her view , consideration of the question should proceed along the same lines as in the past , i.e. as a strictly humanitarian matter .
32 . Mr. RAMADHANE said it was regrettable that , when the question of human rights violations was raised , there was an automatic tendency to think of developing countries and to make no distinction among them .
Yet only in certain developing countries did Governments impose unjust laws , and only certain leaders , to avoid losing power , oppressed the population , sometimes going so far as to commit massacres .
Needless to say , such efforts would have no effect on countries ruled by dictators such as the Sudan , and the human rights community was duty-bound to bring pressure to bear in such cases .
Although some leaders had come to power following a blatant coup d &apos;état , in certain instances extremist parties , using democratic structures and citing Islam , advocated an ideology that was contrary both to Islam and to democracy .
That was the case of the Islamic Salvation Front which , bolstered by the results of democratic elections , had expressed satisfaction that religion had triumphed over democracy .
Thus , democracy could also lead to dictatorship , as Hitler &apos;s coming to power had proved .
That was a danger to certain developing countries which had experience in democracy and respect for human rights but which were very vulnerable because they were in a transition period politically and were experiencing economic difficulties .
They had the greatest need for assistance and encouragement from the international community and the most important democracies .
Democracy would be much stronger in a country in which respect for human rights was inculcated at all levels .
33 . Needless to say , human rights violations were not limited to the developing countries .
In the advanced countries , they often involved plundering the riches and exploiting the labour of less developed countries .
Although it was difficult to resolve immediately all the problems that that entailed , certain suffering due to administrative decisions , such as those concerning family reunification , would be very easy to attenuate .
It would suffice to abrogate the decisions in question .
Human rights violations committed against the elderly and children in Iraq or against the Palestinians in the occupied territories should also rouse the international community .
Pending a settlement of that problem , the human rights community must protect the victims of those violations .
34 . Ms. KSENTINI , returning to the question of Western Sahara , said that in other bodies of the United Nations system and in regional bodies that question had in fact been studied from the point of view of the right to self-determination of the Sahrawi people , a right that was spelled out in article 1 of both Covenants .
It was fully within the competence of the Sub-Commission to address the issue too .
35 . Ms. WARZAZI said that censorship was of place not only for experts , but also for Governments .
36 . Mr. Chernichenko took the Chair .
37 . Mr. POTAPOV ( World Federation of Trade Unions ) said he attached particular importance to violations of trade union rights which , in view of his organization , were a good indication of the true situation in a country with regard to public liberties and fundamental rights .
In the occupied Arab territories , the rights of Palestinian workers , and especially those of their trade union leaders , were flouted in all kinds of ways .
Those workers , who were usually offered illicit employment or very low-paid jobs with little or no social protection , were denied , like the rest of the population , their right to equal treatment by the judicial administration .
According to the media , the partial freeze on settlements in the occupied territories was a &quot; giant step &quot; that gave reason to be optimistic , but those territories were still under the control of the army , and the settlers already there were staying .
As to the situation of Palestinian workers , there had been no improvement whatsoever .
38 . Turning to the Kurdish people , the victim of a veritable genocide attempt , he said he did not understand why that tragedy had not yet been given the attention it deserved by human rights bodies .
The Sub-Commission should request the sending of a commission of inquiry to the countries concerned in order to inform international opinion objectively about the massacres , deportations and other human rights violations that had been perpetrated there .
In Iran , mass executions , detentions , repression and torture , with many victims among trade union leaders and activists , constituted a flagrant violation of human rights .
39 . In Colombia , paramilitary gangs continued to decimate the trade union movement and democratic organizations .
In the Philippines , the progressive trade union movement was the target of killers hired by the employers .
In Turkey , the &quot; prisoners of conscience &quot; included numerous trade unionists , an indication that freedom of opinion and union rights were still not respected .
The Government gave no sign of wanting to modify that situation or to change its legislation .
He also drew the Sub-Commission &apos;s attention to the importance of the Security Council &apos;s decisions concerning Western Sahara .
The Sub-Commission should formulate recommendations on measures to exert appropriate pressure on those States with a poor human rights record which showed no willingness to try and rectify the situation .
Since then , Mr. Fujimori had partially suspended the Constitution , dissolved Congress and dismissed many members of the judiciary .
Disappearances , murders and deaths in detention were continuing with regularity .
The coup d &apos;état had been the dictatorial solution to a conflict between the President and the Parliament , which had taken measures to limit the powers that Mr. Fujimori had improperly assumed with the support of the IMF .
For its part , Shining Path profited from the dictatorship , the repression and the generalized poverty .
As it was an established fact that the President of the Peruvian Republic had broken his word , the Sub-Commission should clearly and without delay call for the immediate and unconditional restoration of the constitutional order , representative democracy and the independence of the judiciary in Peru .
41 . He then turned to the escape from prison of the drug trafficker Pablo Escobar , which illustrated well the current situation in Colombia .
Continuing his criminal activities from prison , which had led to his transfer to another penitentiary , for which more than 300 soldiers had been mobilized , Escobar had clearly relied for his escape on the complicity of persons in high places .
The Procurator of the Republic and the Ministry of the Interior had learned that the general who had commanded those soldiers had personally ordered the killing of 65 peasants in the region of Cayare and that drug traffickers had paid large sums to high-ranking officers of the armed forces .
Meanwhile , children had been murdered or wounded or had disappeared .
The striking contrast between the privileges and complicity that dangerous criminals enjoyed and the mistreatment inflicted upon poor peasants was , unfortunately , typical of Colombia .
The Sub-Commission should appoint an expert to investigate the role of drug trafficking in the deterioration of democratic institutions , the State apparatus and the social fabric and should propose ways to combat it , both in Colombia and in the main consumer countries .
42 . Referring , lastly , to Guatemala , he recalled Commission on Human Rights resolution 1992 / 78 on assistance to that country in the area of human rights ; the account given in the preamble to that resolution of the situation in Guatemala differed greatly from the reality denounced by many NGOs and by Mr. Tomuschat in his report ( E / CN.4 / 1992 / 5 ) .
For its part , the Office of the President of Guatemala had attempted to deceive the people by publishing in the newspapers a truncated version of Commission resolution 1992 / 57 on the civil defence forces under the title &quot; The UN recognizes and approves the role of the civil defence forces &quot; .
Admittedly the Centre for Human Rights had reacted , but it was time to put an end to the ambiguity that had been maintained for many years by studying the situation in Guatemala under agenda item 19 of the Commission , which concerned countries that received assistance in the field of human rights , despite the imperative need to appoint a special rapporteur to examine in depth the massive and systematic need human rights violations in that country and to inform the international community of his findings .
Public attention should also be drawn to the responsibility of States that continued to provide weapons to the Guatemalan armed forces and were thus largely responsible for the sufferings of the Guatemalan people .
43 . Ms. KADJAR-HAMOUDA ( International Federation Terre des Hommes ) said that the situation of the Kurdish minority in Turkey was the result of the deliberate intention of the Turkish Government to deny an entire people its fundamental rights .
According to a delegation of public figures from the United Kingdom who had visited the Kurdish region of Turkey in April 1992 , during the New Year celebrations the army had opened fire on the population of Cizre , killing 12 persons , including at least 3 children .
At Sirnak , a 16-year-old girl had died on 28 March 1992 while in custody .
According to the official version , she had committed suicide , but her body had exhibited signs of blows and torture .
In Diyarbakir , the delegation had seen a 5-year-old child who had been shot and seriously injured while standing on a balcony watching a demonstration .
A doctor in the region had stated that the infant mortality rate and the number of cases of tuberculosis were twice as high as in Istanbul , and there were far too few doctors .
44 . According to a report of Helsinki Watch on the situation of children in Turkey , a 10-year-old child had been arrested and beaten for being in a place where pro-PKK leaflets had been found .
Three children between the ages of 14 and 16 had been arrested and tortured for selling red , green and yellow beads , the colours of the Kurdish flag .
A 10-year-old girl wearing a dress of the same colours had been beaten by the police , because she had refused to remove it in public .
A 17-year-old girl , arrested on 1 September 1991 on a charge of distributing political pamphlets , had been tortured and forced to sign a confession .
According to Helsinki Watch , the torture of children was widespread in Turkey .
45 . Having learned in November 1990 that 105 Kurdish children born between 1973 and 1979 were about to stand trial in Diyarbakir and that 28 of them risked the death penalty , the International Federation Terre des Hommes had made an appeal for clemency to the Turkish authorities .
It had not received any response to date , and it would like to learn the fate of those children .
46 . Turning to the situation in Cambodia , she was concerned to note that the intensity of military activities had not diminished since the signing of the peace agreements on 23 October 1991 .
The repatriation of refugees being undertaken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) had not been able to proceed as planned for lack of unmined arable land and because of the persisting insecurity .
As pointed out by Mr. Asuchi Akashi , head of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia , the refusal of one of the parties to honour the obligations deriving from the agreement it had signed the previous October in Paris constitute a threat to all United Nations operations in Cambodia , including rehabilitation and reconstruction .
It was no secret that the party alluded to was the Khmer Rouge faction , which took advantage of the catastrophic state of the country and socio-economic inequalities , the result of uncontrolled economic liberalism in the towns , to spread dangerous propaganda .
The Khmer Rouge skilfully manipulated opinion among the peasants , who had suffered less than the townspeople from their murderous &quot; exploits &quot; or were too young to remember them .
The economic and social situation was deteriorating , giving the Khmer Rouge real popularity .
Every worsening of the general situation was to their benefit .
47 . The international community must exercise all appropriate pressure to ensure that the agreements concluded were strictly respected by all parties , in particular the Khmer Rouge .
It was necessary to put an end without delay to all banking , commercial and financial operations , especially the trade in wood and precious stones , that enabled the Khmer Rouge to finance their activities and strengthen their positions in the field .
48 . Mr. ALVARADO ( International Association against Torture ) expressed his deep concern at the number of human rights violations reported in Guatemala since the current Government had taken office in January 1991 : 1,113 extrajudicial executions ( accompanied by torture in 157 cases ) , 17 massacres with a total of 70 victims , 90 enforced disappearances , 36 disappearances of children , 741 cases of arbitrary detention , 532 attacks on the right to life , 623 cases of death threats and 85 cases of bombings and machine-gun attacks against the civilian population ; those figures probably understated the real situation , because many witnesses refused to speak for fear of reprisals .
49 . As in the past , the perpetrators of those violations were members of the army , paramilitary gangs ( organized and directed by the army ) , members of the security forces and , in certain cases , members of the civilian self-defence patrols .
The Government claimed that it had taken measures to put an end to the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of those violations . In actual fact , low-ranking soldiers and police officers were placed in detention , and for a short time at that , but not the high-ranking individuals responsible for planning the repression and the physical , moral and psychological destruction of Guatemalan society .
Notwithstanding the recommendation made by Mr. Tomuschat in his report on the situation of human rights in Guatemala ( E / CN.4 / 1992 / 5 ) , the civilian self-defence patrols had still not been abolished and continued to enlist inhabitants , primarily indigenous persons , by force .
Far from applying the few articles of the Constitution aimed at improving the situation of the indigenous communities , the State pursued its policy of discrimination , oppression and marginalization of that part of the population .
Thus , notwithstanding their claims , the armed forces continued to recruit young indigenous persons under duress .
50 . The Guatemalan army accused organizations that sought to improve the human rights situation of being subversive and communist , so as to justify the elimination or disappearance of activists in such groups .
Despite the climate of terror that reigned in the country , the sectors of society most affected by the repressive Government policy had created the Coordinating Assembly of the Civil Sector to propose solutions to economic , social , political and cultural problems so as to respond to the hopes of the entire Guatemalan society that the negotiations conducted by the Government and the army with the Guatemalan National Revolutionary United Front ( URNG ) would lead to concrete agreements based on the needs of the population .
51 . In order to assist the Government and URNG to create the basis for peace , justice and democracy , the Sub-Commission should send a delegation to Guatemala to examine the situation of the persons most affected by the repressive policy of the State , namely the indigenous population ; it should support the initiative of the Mayan people of Guatemala to create an independent body composed of representatives of indigenous and human rights organizations in order better to defend their rights ; it should call upon the Government and URNG to include in the negotiations the social sectors affected by the repression ; and it should adopt a resolution urging the Guatemalan Government fully to respect human rights .
52 . Mr. BEN MALEK ( Observer for Tunisia ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the statement made by the representative of the Union of Arab Jurists during the discussion of the item under consideration on 14 August was based on unfounded information that Tunisia had already refuted on other occasions .
Honoured to have the headquarters of the Arab Institute of Human Rights on its soil , Tunisia had also hosted a section of Amnesty International since 1988 .
That openness of the new Tunisia was part of a policy to strengthen the rule of law .
Tunisia &apos;s achievements in the area of human rights , which the head of that organization had had occasion to see during his recent visit to Tunis , bore witness to its irreversible commitment and choice in favour of democracy .
53 . The right to form political parties was guaranteed in Tunisia , provided that such parties respected the republican character of the State and the principle of the sovereignty of the people , that they worked to preserve national achievements , that they renounced violence and fanaticism and that they were not founded on a confessional , racial , regional or linguistic basis .
Currently , seven legally recognized parties freely exercised their activities .
54 . His delegation had already had occasion to inform the relevant bodies about the system of custody and pre-trial detention in force in Tunisia . No one was arbitrarily detained in Tunisia , there were no prisoners of conscience , and no one was arrested or tried unless he had committed an offence or a crime or been an accessory to such an act .
55 . Mr. FERNANDEZ PALACIO ( Observer for Cuba ) said that on 14 August , Ms. Chavez had made a statement on Cuba similar to the one usually delivered by the official representatives of the United States Government .
He was surprised that as an expert , Ms. Chavez had not said anything about what was happening in her own country , in particular the tragedy of the indigenous populations , which had been decimated , depossessed of their ancestral lands and confined to reserves , in addition to having signed nearly 400 treaties with the United States authorities , none of which had been respected .
She had also failed to explain why the proportion of black people in prison in the United States was four times greater than in South Africa . He wondered how the distinguished expert of the United States could feel entitled to speak of freedom and democracy when such events were occurring in her own country .
How was it that Ms. Chavez , so concerned about human rights in other regions of the world , had not said a word about the criminal blockade which the Government of her country had been enforcing against Cuba for more than 30 years and which constituted a massive and flagrant violation of the human rights of an entire people ?
56 . Ms. PALLEY , speaking on a point of order , asked the Chairman whether an observer had the right to attack an expert of the Sub-Commission or to use expressions that might be regarded as an attack .
57 . The CHAIRMAN said that he had made it a rule to take the greatest care to ensure that all persons participating in the work of the Sub-Commission could , without exception , fully exercise their right to freedom of expression , and that also applied to observers , who exercised their right of reply in order to respond to attacks upon their Governments .
58 . Ms. PALLEY said that freedom of expression should not be used to launch personal attacks against an expert .
While aware that the Chairman was in a difficult situation in the current case , she nevertheless asked him to bear in mind the rule prohibiting the injection of a personal element into replies .
59 . The CHAIRMAN said that he was the Chairman for everyone , without exception , that he had no difficulty assessing any statements at their true value and that he had not noticed , during the statement in question , anything at variance with the rules governing the Sub-Commission &apos;s debates .
60 . Mr. AL-KHASAWNEH said that the attacks of the observer for Cuba had been aimed at the United States , not at Ms. Chavez .
61 . Ms. CHAVEZ said that in her statement she had confined herself to saying that Cuba was one of the last countries in the world that still had a totalitarian Government . She was surprised that it had taken the observer for Cuba so long to reply to such a brief allusion .
62 . The CHAIRMAN said that the observer for Cuba had not exceeded his speaking time , and he invited him , at the suggestion of Mrs. ATTAH , to finish his statement .
63 . Mr. FERNANDEZ PALACIO ( Observer for Cuba ) said that it was for the Cuban delegation alone to determine the importance that should be attached to an attack launched against Cuba . Those who sought to accuse Cuba were demonstrating boundless cynicism , and they were mistaken if they thought that they could act as defenders of human rights , because the day would come when they would have to explain to their own people why they had played the sad role of champions of imperialism .
64 . Mr. MOLLAZADE ( Observer for Azerbaijan ) agreed with Mr. Chernichenko that Azerbaijan and Armenia were truly at war , even if it had not been formally declared .
The Armenian army had crossed the internationally recognized borders of Azerbaijan and it , too , had engaged in a process of ethnic cleansing in Nagorny Karabakh .
It was urgent to find a solution to the conflict , within the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe , that respected the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and the right of the Armenians of Nagorny Karabakh to self-determination .
But self-determination did not necessarily mean secession : Azerbaijan was prepared to grant the Armenians of Nagorny Karabakh broad political , economic , social and cultural autonomy , as well as the right to maintain links with Armenian citizens , as long as they did not endanger the security and territorial integrity of the country .
65 . Mr. CHERNICHENKO , seeking to dissipate any misunderstanding , reaffirmed with regard to the humanitarian situation in Nagorny Karabakh that he did not wish to side with either the Armenians or the Azerbaijanis and that he sympathized with all the victims of confrontations , regardless of the ethnic group to which they belonged .
66 . Mr. ZHANG ( Observer for China ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said he wished to respond to the grave accusations levelled against China on 14 August during the debate on the item under consideration .
One speaker had attacked the social system of China , which she had called the last Communist authoritarian power .
It should be recalled that , in accordance with the International Covenants on Human Rights , peoples freely determined their political status and freely pursued their economic , social and cultural development .
Refusing to submit to the colonial powers that had sought to impose their own model upon it , China had chosen to build a new country whose social system was just as favourable as any other with regard to human rights .
67 . In that connection , he recalled the words spoken in Hong Kong in July 1992 by the former United Nations Secretary-General .
Mr. Pérez de Cuéllar had stated that there was not enough proof to assert that massive human rights violations were taking place in China and that by ensuring respect for the right to life , China was in a better position than many other countries with regard to the defence of human rights .
The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.

CONSIDERATION OF DRAFT RESOLUTIONS AND DECISIONS ( continued )
Question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms , including policies of racial discrimination and segregation and of apartheid , in all countries , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories : report of the Sub-Commission under Commission on Human Rights resolution 8 ( XXIII ) ( agenda item 6 ) ( continued )
Draft decision E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.47 ( continued )
1 . Mr. AL-DOURI ( Observer for Iraq ) thanked the Sub-Commission for its expression of concern at the immense difficulties that the Iraqi people were facing as a result of the economic embargo .
Members had shown that they were aware of their historic and humanitarian responsibilities .
The suffering of the Iraqi people deserved much more than a decision ; a resolution would have been preferable , but his delegation was still grateful .
It was to be hoped that the decision would be taken into account by all States , and especially those that were still hampering the importation of food , medicine and other basic needs since that would alleviate in some small measure the suffering of the Iraqi people .
Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.42 ( continued )
2 . Mr. EIDE noted that every effort had been made to check the information in the draft resolution .
3 . He announced that paragraph 1 should be replaced by the following text : &quot; Deplores the tragic events in Dili on 12 November 1991 , where East Timorese civilians , including women and children , were killed &quot; .
4 . Concerning preambular paragraph 8 , he noted that on 18 November 1991 , a National Commission of Inquiry had been set up and on 26 December 1991 , an advance report had been issued .
A final report was said to have been submitted to President Suharto on 14 April 1992 , but had not been publicized .
The advance report had clearly failed to identify the security personnel responsible for the excessive shooting , which had been termed a &quot; spontaneous reaction &quot; , and it had blamed instead the &quot; aggressive attitude assumed by the crowd &quot; .
The final report seemed to confirm that finding and thus did not constitute as requested in the statement agreed by consensus at the Commission on Human Rights , a further investigation into the action of the security personnel on 12 November 1991 .
At stake was the question of impunity .
5 . Turning to preambular paragraph 12 , he pointed out that access to East Timor had been requested by the Sub-Commission in previous resolutions and in the statement by the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights .
Indonesia had agreed to facilitate visits to East Timor for additional humanitarian and human rights organizations , but Amnesty International , the International Federation of Human Rights and other non-governmental organizations , as well as individuals , continued to be denied access .
It would appear that authorization was only granted to those select organizations invited by the Government , but even the Christian Conference of Asia and the World Council of Churches , which had been invited , had stated that their delegations had had the impression that their movements had been monitored closely by the security personnel and had noted what appeared to be a high level of tension and fear in the community .
In the case of the International Commission of Jurists , which had been allowed to send observers to the trials of East Timorese students in Djakarta , there had been a much more restrictive policy towards presence at the trials in Dili , and one of its observers had even been denied a visa .
6 . Paragraph 5 also addressed the question of impunity .
In its statement , the Commission on Human Rights had welcomed the advance report of the National Commission of Inquiry , but recognizing that the findings were insufficient , it had requested a further investigation , which the Indonesian authorities had then failed to conduct .
Even those security personnel whose actions had been investigated had only been accused of misconduct and had been found guilty of subordination , according to the statement before the Sub-Commission of the Indonesian delegation .
The charge of disobedience was patently absurd and contrary to the findings of the advance report of the National Commission of Inquiry , which had described actions that should be qualified as homicide : the report had spoken of a spontaneous reaction having taken place among the security personnel , resulting in the excessive shooting at the demonstrators , causing deaths and wounded .
Those responsible for the deaths and woundings had not been identified or brought to trial .
7 . In view of the seriousness of the events , the replies of the Indonesian Government had been unsatisfactory .
8 . Mr. JOINET said that despite some progress in the situation under consideration , the draft resolution was still justified .
He noted the tragic events in Dili , the failure of the Portuguese parliamentary delegation and , more generally , the absence of a spirit of openness on the part of Indonesia towards foreign observers .
The objection that other bodies were already addressing the matter and that the Sub-Commission therefore should not pursue it was not valid , inasmuch as there had not been a resolution on the subject by a higher body for several years .
As the Sub-Commission &apos;s expectations had not been met , he called for a vote by secret ballot on the draft resolution .
9 . Mrs. ATTAH endorsed the request for a vote by secret ballot .
10 . Mr. RAHARDJO ( Observer for Indonesia ) said that his delegation deeply regretted that the draft resolution continued to centre on the Dili incident of 12 November 1991 , despite the serious and comprehensive efforts of his Government to follow up on the findings of the National Commission of Inquiry , the conclusions of the Military Honorary Council and the statement by the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights .
Indonesia &apos;s actions to redress the human rights situation in the province had been welcomed in many quarters .
The draft resolution did not reflect the current situation in the province which , nine months after the incident , had greatly improved .
It would be conducive to further improvements in that regard if the Sub-Commission adopted a healthy attitude .
11 . The draft resolution seemed to be less an expression of genuine concern for human rights than a means of scoring political points .
In fact , a certain country had sought to use the draft resolution to achieve what it had failed to obtain through the statement by the Chairman of the Commission , at the expense of unravelling an agreed package , a procedure to which Indonesia was strongly opposed .
12 . While his delegation valued highly the visit to Indonesia of Mr. Kooijmans , Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , and his useful report and recommendations , it disagreed with parts of the report and some of the recommendations contained therein .
13 . The decision to send the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General , Mr. Wako , had been taken jointly by the Secretary-General and his Government on the basis of agreed terms of reference , and any effort to alter the mandate of the Personal Envoy ex post facto was inappropriate .
It would also be procedurally incorrect for the Sub-Commission to interfere with the work of the Commission on Human Rights without a specific request from it to do so .
14 . Concerning the sentences of those involved in the incident , the clarifications given earlier by his delegation were considered sufficient .
He wished to stress that the activities of those who had been sentenced had been by no means peaceful .
The trial proceedings of those involved had proved that the demonstration had not been a spontaneous act , but had been premeditated .
It was therefore rather surprising to hear the view expressed that the investigation into the actions of the military personnel during the incident had not been followed through .
Information on the conclusions of the investigations conducted by the Military Honorary Council and the results of the trials of the military personnel involved had been communicated to the United Nations authorities concerned , both in Geneva and New York .
Thus , there was no question of impunity .
15 . The allegations of continuing widespread human rights violations in East Timor were for the most part unsubstantiated .
On the contrary , his Government had shown its cooperative attitude by replying regularly to all communications received from the relevant United Nations monitoring mechanisms .
Indonesia had always collaborated with the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances by providing the information requested , and together with the village leaders and local teachers it would continue to cooperate with the families of the victims in trying to find those missing .
The local authorities were doing their utmost to investigate those cases .
16 . It was worth mentioning that the representatives of the International Commission of Jurists , foreign journalists and diplomats had been allowed to attend the trials in connection with the Dili incident as observers .
Foreign dignitaries had visited the province , and humanitarian organizations , including the International Committee of the Red Cross , had been operating there continuously since 1979 .
17 . Indonesia had always honoured its international commitments in good faith .
The statement by the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights constituted an agreed package , and all parties must honour the consensus and not pick and choose .
18 . The grossly unbalanced and one-sided draft resolution , far from helping to solve the real problems and improve the actual human rights situation in the province , would in fact undermine the constructive dialogue that had characterized the consenus statements by the Chairman of the Commission and the Chairman of the Sub-Commission .
Such an approach was unlikely to create an environment conducive to improving the human rights situation in East Timor .
19 . In view of the above , his delegation had no choice but to reject the draft resolution as contained in E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.42. It therefore requested the members of the Sub-Commission to exercise their collective wisdom to that effect .
20 . A vote was taken by secret ballot .
21 . At the invitation of the Chairman , Mrs. Warzazi and Mr. Eide acted as tellers .
22 . Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.42 was adopted by 13 votes to 6 , with 4 abstensions .
The administration of justice and the human rights of detainees ( agenda item 10 ) ( continued )
Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.2
23 . Mr. GUISSE said that in order to dispel the impression that the draft resolution applied only to criminal proceedings , he would like to propose a new fourth preambular paragraph which would include a specific reference to civil cases : &quot; Recalling lastly that the right to a fair trial applies both to civil proceedings and to criminal proceedings &quot; .
The former fourth preambular paragraph would then become the new fifth preambular paragraph .
He hoped that the draft resolution as amended , could be adopted without a vote .
24 . Mrs. DAES asked to join the sponsors .
25 . Mrs. KSENTINI inquired when the final report would be concluded .
26 . Mr. CHERNICHENKO said that the final report would be concluded in 1994 .
27 . Mrs. KSENTINI explained that she always inquired about the work schedule for a study .
It was useful to include in a draft resolution a reference to the time when the study would be completed .
If the final report was to be submitted in 1994 , then the word &quot; fifth &quot; in the second line of operative paragraph 4 should be taken to mean &quot; final &quot; .
28 . The CHAIRMAN confirmed that the fifth report would be the final report .
29 . Mr. CISSE ( Centre for Human Rights ) said that if the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council approved the draft decision recommended to them for adoption , the cost estimate would be US $ 7,200 for 1992 and 1993 , already covered by the programme budget , and US $ 7,600 for 1994 , account of which would be taken when the proposed programme budget was prepared .
30 . Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.2 was adopted without a vote .
Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.24
31 . Mr. GUISSE noted that the draft resolution had been almost unanimously supported and hoped that it would be adopted without a vote .
32 . Mrs. DAES and Mrs. ATTAH thanked the Special Rapporteur , Mr. Despouy , for his work and requested that their names be added to the list of sponsors .
33 . Mr. CISSE ( Centre for Human Rights ) informed the Sub-Commission that if the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council approved the expenditure required under operative paragraphs 7 and 10 of the draft resolution , the total cost for 1992-1993 would be US $ 40,175 , already included in the programme budget .
34. draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.24 was adopted without a vote .
Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.28
35 . Mr. DESPOUY , speaking on behalf of all the sponsors , proposed the insertion of an additional paragraph before operative paragraph 4 reading : &quot; Invites Governments , competent United Nations organs , specialized agencies , intergovernmental regional bodies and non-governmental organizations to submit information on the study &quot; .
Because of lack of time , it had not been possible to include in the text some of the ideas put forward by his colleagues .
36 . Mrs. KSENTINI said that she supported the study referred to in the draft resolution but she wanted it to be broad enough to cover all aspects of impunity .
Accordingly , she proposed that in the first preambular paragraph the words &quot; the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other relevant human rights conventions &quot; be included after the words &quot; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights &quot; .
Also , a final preambular paragraph should be added , reading : &quot; Taking note of the contributions submitted and comments made at the forty-fourth session of the Sub-Commission &quot; .
Finally , the question of impunity should not be dealt with under the agenda item entitled &quot; The administration of justice and the human rights of detainees &quot; ( item 10 ) but the item entitled &quot; Review of further developments in fields with which the Sub-Commisssion has been concerned &quot; ( item 4 ) .
37 . Mrs. WARZAZI noted that the importance of the study had been such that two Special Rapporteurs had been needed , a practice of which she did not approve .
She asked how they would divide the work between them .
38 . Mr. GUISSE explained that the two Special Rapporteurs would make a joint intellectual effort and work on the same document together .
The proposal to consider it under agenda item 10 had been made because of its connection with the denial of justice .
39 . Mr. JOINET recalled that the first working paper had been prepared by himself alone .
There had then been a discussion on the past , particularly in Africa , and he had requested Mr. Guissé to assist him .
A similar situation had risen with regard to the study on freedom of opinion .
However , he agreed with Mrs. Warzazi that the practice of having two special rapporteurs should not become standardized .
40 . Mr. TIAN Jin supported Mrs. Ksentini &apos;s amendment to the first preambular paragraph .
41 . Mr. SACHAR said that he wished to be included in the list of sponsors .
42 . Mrs. KSENTINI said that if the sponsors accepted her amendments , she would wish to join them .
43 . The CHAIRMAN said that , if there was no objection , he would take it that the sponsors agreed to the three amendments proposed .
44 . It was so decided .
45 . Mr. CISSE ( Centre for Human Rights ) said that if the new mandate were approved by the Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council , the total cost estimate for 1993 would be US $ 23,475 .
46 . Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.28 , as amended , was adopted without a vote .
47 . Mr. DESPOUY requested that next year the Special Rapporteurs should explain the precise scope of what was understood by &quot; impunity &quot; .
Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.36
48 . Mrs. DAES , introducing the draft resolution on behalf of the 14 co-sponsors , said that every year approximately 100 staff members of the United Nations , the specialized agencies and related organizations were arrested , detained , reported missing , held in a country against their will , killed or even executed .
Some were kidnapped or murdered by &quot; unknown elements &quot; while others died or disappeared in detention , with no explanation being offered by the Governments concerned .
Those incidents occurred primarily in the troubled areas of the world where the United Nations system operated .
As the Organization continued to expand its operations into new conflict areas such as Angola , Cambodia , Somalia and Yugoslavia , it would have to ensure the security of even more staff .
Many risked their lives to carry out their work .
Some had paid the ultimate price and the number of casualties had risen dramatically since the beginning of the year .
The rehabilitation of staff members who had spent many years in prison and suffered cruel and degrading treatment also posed problems to the United Nations and its specialized agencies .
49 . The final report ( E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 19 ) prepared by Mrs. Bautista offered useful recommendations in relation to information on cases of violations of human rights , possible action to be taken , compensation , rehabilitation , security on mission and follow-up action .
The draft resolution expressed the appreciation of the Sub-Commission to the Special Rapporteur for the work she had done .
50 . It should be borne in mind that if the United Nations was to fulfil its mandate properly , it was indispensable that international civil servants as well as experts , special rapporteurs and other persons acting under the authority of the United Nations be able to accomplish the task entrusted to them without interference and in conditions of security .
51 . The co-sponsors had accepted some simple amendments .
In the second line of the first preambular paragraph the words &quot; including experts , special rapporteurs and consultants &quot; should be inserted after the words &quot; other persons &quot; .
In the third line of the same paragraph the word &quot; system &quot; should be added after the words &quot; United Nations &quot; .
In the second line of the fourth preambular paragraph the words &quot; and the above-mentioned other persons &quot; should be added after the words &quot; staff members &quot; .
In the fifth line of operative paragraph 3 the words &quot; the United Nations &quot; should be replaced by the words &quot; the competent organs of the United Nations system &quot; .
In the second line of operative paragraph 5 the words &quot; or the above-mentioned other persons and their families &quot; should be inserted after the words &quot; the United Nations system &quot; .
In the first line of operative paragraph 8 the words &quot; Calls upon &quot; should be replaced by the words &quot; Recommends to &quot; .
Finally , in line 6 of operative paragraph 3 in the draft resolution recommended for adoption by the Commission on Human Rights , the words &quot; specialists and consultants &quot; should be added after the word &quot; experts &quot; .
52 . She hoped that , in view of its importance , the draft resolution would be adopted by consensus .
53 . Mrs. ATTAH said that she wished to be added to the list of sponsors . She hoped that incidents of disappearances , imprisonment and hardship endured by staff members would be reduced .
The Sub-Commission should appeal to the Governments concerned to release imprisoned staff members .
54 . Mr. BOUTKEVITCH and Mr. JOINET said that they wished to become sponsors of the draft resolution .
55 . Mr. GUISSE endorsed Mrs. Daes &apos; comments and expressed his strong support for the protection of the families of staff members .
He proposed that the words &quot; and appeals to the Governments of countries where staff members of the United Nations and assimilated persons are being detained to release them immediately &quot; be added at the end of operative paragraph 1 .
If that amendment was accepted , he wished to become a sponsor .
56 . Mrs. PALLEY said that she , too , wished to be added to the list of sponsors . She wondered whether the Chairman could not declare that the draft resolution was sponsored by all members of the Sub-Commission .
57 . The CHAIRMAN replied that such a course would probably be incorrect under the rules of procedure .
Any member who wanted to become a sponsor should indicate his or her intention of doing so .
58 . Mrs. DAES said that the sponsors could accept the amendment proposed by Mr. Guissé .
59 . Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.36 , as amended , was adopted without
Draft decision E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.38
60 . Mrs. KSENTINI asked how it would be possible for Mrs. Palley to prepare a preliminary report without financial implications , as requested in the draft decision .
61 . The CHAIRMAN said that the term rapport préliminaire in the French version was obviously a mistranslation of the term &quot; outline &quot; in the English original .
62 . Mr. JOINET said that , under the terms of Guideline No. 2 contained in draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.15 , adopted the previous day , the document in question should in fact be entitled a &quot; preparatory document &quot; .
Now that those Guidelines had been adopted , it was important to use the terminology established therein .
63 . The CHAIRMAN pointed out that draft decision E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.38 had been drafted some considerable time before the adoption of draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.15.
64 . Mr. GUISSE said that the sponsors would be willing to substitute the term &quot; preparatory document &quot; for &quot; outline &quot; .
65 . Mr. CISSE ( Centre for Human Rights ) confirmed that the draft decision had no administrative or financial implications .
66 . Draft decision E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.38 was adopted without a vote .
Draft resolution on the application of international standards concerning the human rights of detained juveniles
67 . At the invitation of the Chairman , Mrs. WARZAZI read out the text of a draft resolution on the application of international standards concerning the human rights of detained juveniles , which , if adopted , would subsequently be issued as Sub-Commission resolution 1992 / 25 .
68 . Mr. DESPOUY , Mrs. KSENTINI and Mr. SACHAR asked to become sponsors of the draft resolution .
69 . The CHAIRMAN drew the experts &apos; attention to the administrative and financial implications of the draft resolution .
70 . Draft resolution 1992 / 25 , as orally presented by Mrs. Warzazi and amended by Mrs. Ksentini , was adopted without a vote .
Independence and impartiality of the judiciary , jurors and assessors and the independence of lawyers ( agenda item 11 ) ( continued )
Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.39
71 . Mr. SACHAR asked to become a sponsor of the draft resolution .
72 . Mr. DESPOUY stated his readiness to provide any necessary clarifications . He hoped that , on the assumption that there were no financial implications , the text could be adopted by consensus .
73 . The CHAIRMAN , speaking in his capacity as a member of the Sub-Commission , drew attention to the final sentence of operative paragraph 2 ( a ) of the draft resolution , also reproduced as operative paragraph 4 ( a ) of the text to be proposed to the Commission on Human Rights for adoption .
Were the &quot; contradictory procedures &quot; referred to therein domestic procedures within individual countries ? Or did the draft resolution envisage the introduction of some new special procedure within the United Nations system , along the lines of the procedure currently used by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ?
74 . Mr. JOINET said that the two recommendations set forth as options 1 and 2 in document E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 25 / Add.1 were alternatives , not cumulative options .
The Sub-Commission must express a preference for one or the other option in its recommendation to the Commission on Human Rights .
The text thus made no sense as currently drafted .
75 . Mr. DESPOUY , in response to the Chairman &apos;s question , said that neither domestic procedures nor the possibility of establishing special procedures within the United Nations system were referred to . The reference was to the possibility of the Special Rapporteur taking account of information from both non-governmental and governmental sources , so as to offer Governments a chance of rebutting the allegations made .
76 . The CHAIRMAN said that he understood from Mr. Despouy &apos;s comments that the Special Rapporteur would himself establish the contradictory procedures referred to , in the context of his reports .
77 . Mrs. KSENTINI was also unclear as to the exact nature of the contradictory procedures proposed .
Furthermore , she wished to know the precise meaning of the expression &quot; in carrying out his task , he will take initiatives ... &quot; , which occurred in the same two paragraphs .
78 . Mr. YIMER , speaking on a point of order , proposed that the Sub-Commission should proceed with the adoption of those draft resolutions which were not controversial and leave it to the co-sponsors of draft resolutions on which there was no agreement to settle the matter .
Otherwise , the Sub-Commission would not have sufficient time to finish its work .
79 . Mr. JOINET said that the answers to the questions which had been raised were to be found in document E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / 25 / Add.1 ; with that document at hand , the co-sponsors should be able to work out an acceptable text .
80 . The CHAIRMAN ruled that the Sub-Commission would proceed to consider the draft resolutions under item 8 and revert to draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.39 later .
The realization of economic , social and cultural rights ( agenda item 8 ) ( continued )
Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.22
81 . Mr. CISSE ( Centre for Human Rights ) said that the total cost of the activities under paragraphs 3 and 4 of the draft resolution would be $ 20,475 .
82 . Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.22 was adopted without a vote .
Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.27
83 . Mr. CISSE ( Centre for Human Rights ) said that , if the Commission and the Economic and Social Council should approve the proposals contained in the draft resolution , the total cost estimates would be $ 38,450 .
84 . Mrs. ATTAH requested that her name should be added to the list of sponsors .
85 . Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.27 was adopted without a vote .
Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.40
86 . Mr. CISSE ( Centre for Human Rights ) said that if the Commission on Human Rights should approve the activities under paragraphs 2 and 6 of the draft resolution , the cost estimates would be $ 26,450 .
87 . Mr. GUISSE and Mrs. ATTAH asked to become co-sponsors .
88 . Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.40 was adopted without a vote .
Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.48
89 . Mr. BOUTKEVITCH , Mr. GUISSE , Mrs. ATTAH and Mrs. WARZAZI requested that their names should be added to the list of sponsors .
90 . Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.48 was adopted without a vote .
Review of further developments in fields with which the Sub-Commission has been concerned ( agenda item 4 ) ( continued )
Draft resolution E / CN.4 / Sub.2 / 1992 / L.8
91 . Mrs. KSENTINI asked to become a co-sponsor .
92 . Mr. SACHAR said that in operative paragraph 4 of the draft resolution he would propose that the phrase following the words &quot; while reaffirming that development ... &quot; be replaced by &quot; and democracy are not antithetical but rather complementary &quot; .
His proposed wording would correspond more closely to the original French text of the document of the Dakar Conference .
93 . Mr. YIMER said that , as the Dakar document was being cited , it should be correctly translated as Mr. Sachar had suggested .
94 . Mrs. KSENTINI said that operative paragraph 7 should start with the words &quot; Also notes &quot; .
95 . The CHAIRMAN said that , if there was no objection , he would take it that those proposals were acceptable to the Sub-Commission .
96 . It was so decided .

Implementation Committee under
the Non-Compliance Procedure for
the Montreal Protocol
Fourth Meeting
Geneva , 14 September 1992
COMMITTEE UNDER THE NON-COMPLIANCE PROCEDURE
FOR THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL
I. INTRODUCTION
1 . The Fourth Meeting of the Implementation Committee under the Non-Compliance Procedure for the Montreal Protocol was held at the Palais de Nations , Geneva on 14 September 1992 .
II . ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS
2 . The President of the Committee , Mrs. Carola Bjorklund , opened the meeting and welcomed all the participants , including the representatives from the Interim Multilateral Fund ( &quot; IMLF &quot; ) and the three implementing agencies of IMLF , i.e. United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , United Nations Environment Programme / Industry and Environment / Programme Activity Centre ( UNEP / IE / PAC ) and the World Bank , who were participating in the meeting of the Implementation Committee for the first time .
3 . The Committee had before it for its consideration the Report of the Secretariat on the Reporting of Data by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 6 ) and the information on country programmes / studies carried out by the implementing agencies of the IMLF and their results .
4 . The meeting was attended by representatives from Cameroon , Chile , Hungary , Japan , Norway , Thailand , Uganda and the United States as well as from the IMLF , UNDP , UNEP / IE / PAC , and the World Bank .
The Russian Federation and Trinidad and Tobago did not attend .
Na.92-6089 151092 5 . The meeting adopted the following agenda contained in document UNEP / OzL.Pro. / ImpCom / 4 / 1 and made changes to agenda item 3 ( b ) to include country programmes :
1 . Opening of the meeting
2 . Adoption of the agenda
3 . Substantive matters :
( a ) Report of the Secretariat on data .
( b ) Information on country programmes / studies which have been conducted by implementing agencies under the Multilateral Fund and their results .
4 . Other matters
5 . Adoption of the report
6 . Closure of the meeting
SUBSTANTIVE MATTERS
A. Report of the Secretariat on Data
6 . The Secretariat introduced the Report of the Secretariat on the Reporting of Data by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 6 ) ( the &quot; Report &quot; ) and explained the current status of the Parties with regard to reporting under Articles 4 , 7 and 9 of the Protocol .
The Secretariat expressed its gratitude to the Global Resource Information Database Programme Activity Centre ( GRID / PAC ) of UNEP , Nairobi for the excellent professional assistance given to the Secretariat for developing a new database system .
7 . The Committee reviewed the Report paragraph by paragraph and provided comments to the Secretariat .
It was suggested that Decision I / II concerning reporting of data should be included in Paragraph 1 of the Report .
The Secretariat was requested to reconcile the differences between the number of Parties shown as reporting in 1989 in UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 6 and UNEP / OzL.Pro. / Imp / Com / 3 / 3 .
It was suggested that if a Party which does not report or which reports incomplete data provides an explanation for this , such information should be reflected in the report .
As regards the reliability of data reported , it was noted that the Committee has no mandate to verify the data reported by the Parties .
8 . On the issue of compliance with the control measures , the Committee noted the positive situation of many of the Parties reducing their consumption of controlled substances much beyond the extent called for by the control measures of the Protocol .
These Parties account for a major portion of the production and consumption of controlled substances in the world .
Concern was expressed over the trend toward increased consumption of controlled substances , particularly halons , by some Parties operating under Article 5 .
Concern was also expressed at non-reporting or late reporting by many Parties .
9 . The Secretariat informed the Committee that the European Community ( &quot; EC &quot; ) data for 1990 had been received by the Secretariat on September 10 , 1992 and , therefore , had not yet been analyzed and could not be considered by the Committee at this stage .
The Committee indicated that the concern about consumption raised in relation to one EC member country in the report is no more valid since EC data has now been received .
10 . The Committee discussed the problem of getting accurate population data from the Parties .
The Secretariat suggested that Parties should send population data along with their data on controlled substances .
However , some members supported the current practice of obtaining population data from the UN statistical office because it may be more reliable than data obtained directly from an individual country .
A member from a developing country pointed out that some developing countries may have difficulty in reporting accurate population statistics for each year because it takes a long time to conduct a population census and analyze the results .
The President suggested that the Secretariat further consider which source of population data is more accurate and utilize the data it determines to be most appropriate for analysis under the Protocol .
One member pointed out an inconsistency in the Nigerian population data contained in Tables 2 and 3 .
The Committee asked the Secretariat to verify the data and make the appropriate correction .
11 . Several questions were raised concerning the background on certain activities reported by Parties under Article 9 .
The Committee accepted the position expressed by the Secretariat that it does not inquire into the background of information reported by the Parties under Article 9 .
12 . The Committee discussed , in the context of facilitating reporting , efforts that have been made so far to adopt a harmonized system of custom codes for controlled substances .
The Secretariat explained the process and difficulties involved in adopting a uniform set of code numbers for all the controlled substances by all countries .
The Customs Co-operation Council has designated six-digit numbers for groups of substances .
Each country can add two or three more digits and develop its own system of numbering for the controlled substances .
The numbering system will be useful for reporting only if it gives a separate number to each of the controlled and transitional substances , since the reporting under Article 7 is for each of substances individually .
Some countries such as New Zealand have already adopted such systems .
The Committee requested the Secretariat to provide information on all countries implementing the harmonized system to enable monitoring of imports and exports of controlled substances .
This information should be provided to the Parties so that each country can adopt a system which is most appropriate to meet its needs .
B. Information on country studies / programmes conducted by the implementing agencies under the Fund and their results in respect of reporting by Parties operating under Paragraph 1 of Article 5
13 . The Chief Officer , IMLF reported on the activities of the Fund todate .
The representatives of each of the implementing agencies ( UNDP , UNEP and the World Bank ) presented information on the country programmes and country studies which they are carrying out and the effect of these activities on development and reporting of data as required by the Montreal Protocol .
The information given is summarised below .
i . Interim Multilateral Fund
14 . At their Second Meeting , the Parties to the Montreal Protocol established an Executive Committee to develop and monitor the implementation of specific operational policies , guidelines and administrative arrangements , including disbursement of resources for achieving the objectives of the Fund .
In addition to completing a number of other activities related to implementation of the Fund , the Executive Committee has approved :
( 1 ) funding for the preparation of 37 country programmes ( with funding approval for two additional programmes envisioned for 1992 ) at a total cost of $ 1.7 million ;
( 2 ) four country programmes of Chile , Ecuador , Malaysia and Mexico have been approved .
The Chile country programme is fully funded at $ 1.206 million to enable Chile to phase out 67 % of the country &apos;s total consumption of controlled substances within a four year period ;
( 3 ) 67 projects in 13 countries , including investment projects aimed at phase out of approximately 25,000 metric tons of ozone depleting substances at a cost of $ 35 million ; and
( 4 ) disbursements to implementing agencies and the Fund Secretariat .
15 . The Executive Committee has resolved most of the key policy concerns relating to implementation of the Fund through the development of policy papers , guidelines and criteria on the following issues :
( 1 ) institutional strengthening of Parties operating under Article 5 ;
( 2 ) guidelines for the preparation of country programmes and project proposals , which , inter alia , are based on both the sector and cumulative consumption and production of controlled substances and the projected growth in production and consumption ;
( 3 ) specific criteria to address the availability of resources for enterprises in countries operating under Article 5 that are partially or wholly owned by multinational corporations or non-Parties ;
( 4 ) criteria for determining whether funding can be provided for projects or activities undertaken before a Party filed an application for funding under the Multilateral Fund .
ii .
The United Nations Development Programme
16 . The UNDP representative reported on current activities of UNDP undertaken to assist Parties operating under Article 5 to phase out production and consumption of controlled substances .
UNDP provides assistance to countries operating under Article 5 in the following areas : on site / in country technical training ; sectoral and / or regional demonstration and training workshops ; assistance in country programme formulation ; institutional strengthening for ozone layer protection ; design and implementation of demonstration projects ; preparation of feasibility and pre-investment studies ; investment project design and implementation ; and promotion of technical and managerial sustainability of projects and programmes .
17 . In 1992 , UNDP is the lead agency for country programme preparation in seven countries ( Bangladesh , China , Costa Rica , Iran , Kenya , Sri Lanka , Trinidad and Tobago ) and has ongoing sectoral / regional / national technical assistance , training and demonstration activities in twenty-two countries .
UNDP &apos;s technical assistance follows a sectoral approach covering aerosols , mobile air-conditioning , refrigeration and air-conditioning , rigid and flexible foams , solvents and halons .
UNDP cooperates closely with the World Bank and UNEP in project and programme design and implementation .
18 . UNDP is assisting countries which are very large consumers of controlled substances to develop databases to track consumption and production of ozone depleting substances ( ODS ) .
This data could be used to provide the data required under Article 7 of the Protocol .
iii .
UNEP Industry and Environment / Programme Activity Centre
19 . The representative of the IE / PAC presented the efforts made by the Centre in assisting the countries in reporting the statistical data as per Article 7 , while conducting the country programmes .
IE / PAC is conducting or will soon begin country programmes in fourteen countries which are low volume users of ozone depleting substances , Botswana , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Fiji , Gambia , Ghana , Guatemala , Malawi , Maldives , Panama , Syria , Togo , Uganda and Zambia .
20 . Along with an ODS survey , institutional structure , strategies and action plans for phase-out of ODS , each national team is appraised of the various obligations of Parties under the Montreal Protocol .
The problem of complying with the reporting requirements under Article 7 of the Protocol has been taken into account in the country programme preparation process for six countries , Zambia , Ghana , Fiji , Maldives , Syria and Uganda .
For other countries , the country programmes are yet to start or have just started .
Most of the countries do not have adequate record keeping and monitoring systems to enable the government to report the required data .
Only Ghana has established a system to monitor the import of controlled substances .
Since 1990 , all importers in Ghana are required to report their chemical imports to the Environmental Protection Council which must approve the importation . The system enables Ghana to report the data required under Article 7 of the Protocol .
The problem of compliance with Article 7 has been pursued under the country programme preparation for Zambia , Fiji , Maldives and Syria , as described below :
( a ) The reporting requirements under the Montreal Protocol and the importance of reporting on each controlled substance was explained to the appropriate Ministry .
( b ) The country programme preparation included a survey of the consumption of controlled substances for 1986 , 1989 , 1990 and 1991 .
From the survey , the major importers and users of controlled substances were identified .
Import data on each controlled substance were obtained directly from the relevant industries / companies .
There is no production of controlled substances in these countries .
( c ) The activities conducted by UNEP during preparation of country programmes included facilitation of establishment of monitoring arrangements and systems for improved record keeping in order to enable monitoring of the importation and use of controlled substances .
This will allow : ( i ) observation and evaluation of the effectiveness of the country programme in reducing and phasing out the consumption of the controlled substances and ( ii ) compliance with Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol .
( d ) The representative of the IE / PAC also explained the efforts made by the Centre along with the Ozone Secretariat in assisting countries in reporting data under Article 7 during three Regional Workshops it held in 1991-92 .
IE / PAC also indicated that its regional office in Bangkok had completed a study paper on data collection problems in April 1992 .
iv .
The World Bank
22 . The World Bank representative reported that as of 12 September 1992 , the Bank has completed eight country programmes , including assistance for the development of institutional strengthening .
The Bank is also assisting thirteen countries of Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States in developing country programmes and projects .
As a result of these country projects and programmes , the Bank expects that more countries will report data under Article 7 of the Protocol next year .
23 . The Committee expressed its appreciation to the Chief Officer , IMLF and the representatives of the implementing agencies for the presentations made .
It noted that the work of the IMLF and its implementing agencies is of great relevance to the work of the Implementation Committee in monitoring the compliance of the Parties operating under Article 5 , Paragraph 1 .
It , is , therefore , essential that the Implementation Committee and the Fund work closely together and exchange information regularly .
The Chief Officer , IMLF concurred with this view and stated that such information exchange is essential and mutually beneficial .
C. Other Matters
24 . The hypothetical issue of a Party operating under Article 5 of the Protocol exceeding its per capita consumption beyond 0.3 kg was briefly discussed and it was noted that this issue is on the Agenda of the Fourth Meeting of the Parties .
25 . The issue of whether a developing country not operating under Article 5 would be eligible for reclassification as a party operating under Article 5 if it reduces its per capita consumption to below 0.3 kg was raised and it was noted that this is an issue of legal interpretation of the Protocol .
D. Adoption of the Report
26 . It was agreed that a draft report would be sent to the members shortly after the meeting for their comments and that the Secretariat would finalize the report taking into account the comments received .
E. Closure of the Meeting
27 . After the customary exchange of courtesies , the President declared the Meeting closed at 4.15 pm on Monday , 14 September 1992 .

REPORT OF THE FOURTH MEETING OF THE PARTIES TO THE
THE OZONE LAYER
1 . The Fourth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was held at the Bella Center , Copenhagen , from 23 to 25 November 1992 , at the invitation of the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark .
I. OPENING OF THE MEETING
2 . Following the entry into the hall of Her Majesty the Queen of Denmark , at 10.15 a.m. on Monday , 23 November 1992 , Mr. P. Chin Fah Kui , Deputy Minister of Science , Technology and the Environment of Malaysia and Vice-President of the Third Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol , started the proceedings .
A. Statement by the representative of the Government of Denmark
3 . His Excellency Mr. Stig Moller , Minister of the Environment of Denmark , welcomed participants on behalf of the people and Government of Denmark and stated that he was deeply honoured by the presence in the hall of Her Majesty the Queen of Denmark .
4 . He said that the task of the Meeting was to phase out as quickly as possible ozone-depleting chemicals , while ensuring environmentally sound development for the developing countries .
The Montreal Protocol also must be used to set the trend for international cooperation in other fields , such as climate change , biodiversity and hazardous waste .
Now was the chance to show that the pledges to save the Earth made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development were meaningful .
5 . Praising the great contribution to international environmental cooperation of the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , Dr. Mostafa Tolba , he said that with the Executive Director &apos;s retirement from UNEP , the environment was saying good-bye to an outstanding driving force . Na.92-6155 151292
B. Statement by Dr. M.K. Tolba , Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme
6 . Dr. Tolba , Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , having expressed his gratitude to the Government and people of Denmark for hosting the meeting , said that ozone-layer depletion was unique among global environmental problems in that its causes and cures were known , a timetable for , and the approximate cost of , implementing the solutions had been worked out , and the wealthy nations had agreed to meet the costs of , and to pass on their know-how to , the less fortunate .
The Protocol had , by any standard , achieved wide success .
The world would , however , continue to pay , for decades to come , for the 14-year delay between the identification of the problem in 1973 and the signing of the Protocol in 1987 .
The lesson from that experience was that the best approach was to err on the side of caution , heed early warnings and insist that the burden of proof lay with those who would experiment with the natural workings of the world .
7 . Outlining the issues before the Meeting , he said that it had three days to decide how humanity would respond to the growing threat to the ozone layer .
The phase-out of controlled substances had to be accelerated , the use of transitional substances held back and phase-out schedules initiated for hydrochlorofluorocarbons , as well as methyl bromide .
In addition , an agreement was needed to link the application of the amendment and adjustments in developing countries to the 1995 review of financial resources and technology transfer , and it was also essential to establish the Multilateral Fund , to commit to its replenishment and to decide on the level of contributions to it , at least for 1994 .
8 . Finally , he expressed his confidence that the Parties would in their deliberations be guided by one criterion above all others : the protection of the ozone layer .
The next generation deserved an ozone layer as good as nature could provide .
It was the current generation that had done the damage and it was for that generation to undo it .
C. Statement by the Acting President of the
Third Meeting of the Parties
He also expressed his gratitude to the Executive Director of UNEP for his determined leadership and wisdom , to his colleagues in the Bureau , to the Ozone Secretariat and , in particular , to the Government and the people of Denmark and Her Majesty the Queen for hosting the meeting .
10 . He said the Montreal Protocol had broken new ground in the international efforts and cooperation to protect the global environment .
He was , however , somewhat concerned that the London Amendment had not entered into force according to schedule , owing to the late receipt of ratifications .
Implementation of international agreements like the Protocol must take place swiftly and without delay .
He therefore urged all countries to ratify the amended Protocol as soon as possible .
11 . The period since the Third Meeting had been an exciting one .
While he was reasonably happy with the success of the implementation of the Protocol and the Interim Multilateral Fund , he would point out that there had recently been certain rather unsatisfactory developments such as attempts by some countries to alter the structure of the Multilateral Fund and the failure of a great many countries to pay their contributions to the Fund .
These matters coupled with moves to accelerate the phase-out of ozone- depleting substances were causing much concern to developing countries , and he hoped that they could be resolved amicably by the Parties .
D. Departure of Her Majesty the Queen of Denmark
12 . At the end of the opening ceremony , Her Majesty the Queen of Denmark left the hall .

Two delegations made statements on the subject , which are to be found in Annex XVI to this report .
A. Presentation of reports
1 . Synthesis report of the assessment panels
22 . Mr. Watson , Co-Chairman of the Ozone Scientific Assessment Panel and overall Chairman of the Assessment Panels , presented a report on the work of the scientific , environmental impacts , and technology and economic assessment panels based on the 1991 assessment reports and the interim scientific , technology and economic assessment of methyl bromide in 1992 .
He said that ozone depletion was significantly more serious than it had been in 1990 and that there was no doubt that it was caused primarily by the emission of anthropogenic chemicals containing chlorine and bromine .
It was clear that the potential existed for large-scale ozone depletion over the Arctic and surrounding populated areas in both winter and spring .
For the first time , serious levels of UV-B radiation had been observed in conjunction with ozone depletion over Antarctica and Australia and in a mountainous region of Europe , and its effects had started to become noticeable in the real world , with damage to phytoplankton observed in Antarctica during the period of the ozone hole .
Even if the London control measures were to be implemented globally , the atmospheric abundance of chlorine would increase from the current level of about 3.5 ppbv to over 4 ppbv around the year 2000 .
The scientific community now also recognized that atmospheric ozone was threatened by the anthropogenic emissions of methyl bromide , which could have accounted for between 5 and 10 per cent of the observed ozone loss during the previous 10 to 20 years .
If production of methyl bromide continued to increase at its historical rate , it could account for 15 per cent of predicted ozone depletion by the year 2000 .
23 . From a scientific perspective , protection of the ozone layer could be achieved by taking all technically and economically feasible measures to minimize atmospheric concentrations of bromine and chlorine , including a phase-out of the substances currently controlled under the Protocol , as rapidly as technically and economically possible ; the recovery and banking of CFCs and halons ; the reduction to a minimum of emissions of methyl bromide ; and the minimization of the initial substitution rates of HCFCs , followed by the most technically and economically feasible phase-out of those substances .
In particular , he emphasized that controls on methyl chloroform and methyl bromide had the greatest effect on limiting ozone depletion during the next one to two decades because of their short atmospheric lifetimes .
Adoption of measures similar to those presented by the Executive Director would halve the integrated amount of ozone depletion over the next several decades and the chronic effects of UV-B radiation .
Methyl bromide emissions could also be significantly reduced by a variety of measures , including substitution , improved management practices and containment and recovery .
It must , however , be noted that partnerships between developed and developing countries were needed and that access to technology and financing were essential .
In that respect , the Multilateral Fund was vital for the early elimination of controlled substances in developing countries .
2 . Report of the Chairman of the Executive Committee
of the Interim Multilateral Fund for the
Implementation of the Montreal Protocol
25 . Mr. Mateos , Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Interim Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol , said that , after four meetings of the Committee , the initial critics had been proved wrong , as representatives of the developed and developing countries worked side by side , adopting all decisions by consensus and taking into consideration the concerns of all members .
To date , 60 projects had been approved for the phase-out of more than 30,000 tonnes of ozone-depleting substances , which represented 20 per cent of the total consumption of the developing countries party to the Protocol .
Using a flexible approach , the Committee had approved all bilateral contributions , the work programmes and , sometimes with amendments , the project proposals submitted to it .
As at October 1992 , it had allocated funds for the preparation of 39 country programmes , 9 of which had already been approved .
All doubts about policy had been resolved promptly and decisively , it being the implicit task of the Committee to ensure that there was no delay in allocating available funds .
In that connection , the Fund Secretariat had a basic role in facilitating the approval of projects .
Having drawn the attention of the Meeting to the subject matter of the decisions adopted by the Committee as set out in its report ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 8 , para . 6 ) , he said that the mechanisms provided by the Parties enabled the Fund to function and guided the Committee in its decisions .
He did not believe that any changes were necessary at the moment .
26 . Turning to the Committee &apos;s plans for the preparation of country programmes , he said that the initial results had exceeded expectations , with all nine approved programmes aimed at the phase-out of controlled substances and most countries involved committing themselves to phasing out the substances according to the same schedule as that followed by non-Article 5 Parties .
The Fund &apos;s cooperation and the belief that its financial resources were available in support of national efforts were integral to the assumption of those voluntary commitments .
With the approval of the China country programme , strategies would have been developed to eliminate more than half of current consumption of controlled substances in developing countries party to the Protocol .
The Committee was also dealing with institution-building , training and information exchange , and the improvement of the data-reporting capabilities of developing countries .
He was , however , concerned that , without more financial resources , the Committee &apos;s work would be totally blocked .
Parties that wished to avoid paying should state so openly so that the Committee &apos;s work could proceed more smoothly .
27 . For the future , there was a need to speed up the conclusion of agreements between recipient countries and the implementing agencies , increase the number of requests for projects , and improve coordination and cooperation among the four implementing agencies , to which he was grateful for having introduced innovations in their internal procedures .
Finally , he expressed his concern about the barriers to speedy project implementation , a matter which a subcommittee had recently been established to evaluate .
3 . Report of the Implementation Committee to the Fourth Meeting
of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances
that Deplete the Ozone Layer
28 . Ms. Carola Bjorklund , President of the Implementation Committee , said that the Committee represented a new form for settling disputes outside the traditional judicial framework .
It was important that it was given , by the Meeting of the Parties , effective rules of procedure and a mandate to enable it to fulfil its task .
Such a regime would undoubtedly increase chances of reaching amicable resolutions which the draft non-compliance procedure set out as the main goal for the Committee .
It was the intermediate role envisaged for the Committee that was essential and made it the main provider of vital information for the Parties with regard to their own control of States &apos; compliance .
The Implementation Committee had tested the draft non-compliance procedures ( UNEP / OzL.Pro / WG.3 / 3 / 3 ) over a two-year period and had found the mandate to be both efficient and appropriate for supporting its work .
The members of the Committee fully supported the work produced by the Ad Hoc Working Group of Legal Experts and had noted with satisfaction that the Preparatory Meeting for the Fourth Meeting of the Parties had responded positively to the proposed non-compliance procedure as contained in annex IV of the draft decisions before the Meeting ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / L.1 / Rev.1 ) .
With regard to annexes V and VI of the same document , she recalled that , at the Third Meeting of the Parties , the Implementation Committee had stressed that it would be useful for it to be provided with an indicative list of advisory and conciliatory measures , indicating what appropriate measures the Committee might recommend to be taken by the Meeting of the Parties in respect of Parties in non-compliance with the Protocol .
29 . Having drawn the attention of the Meeting to the reporting statistics contained in the Secretariat &apos;s report on the reporting of data by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 6 and Corr.1 ) , she said that many Parties , which also accounted for a major portion of the production and consumption of controlled substances in the world , had reduced their consumption much beyond the extent called for by the Protocol .
On the other hand , the Committee had noted with some concern that there was a trend of increased consumption of controlled substances , particularly halons , by some Parties operating under Article 5 .
Two other problems noted by the Committee were the pattern of late reporting by many Parties and the problem of getting accurate population data .
Some developing countries still seemed to have serious problems in fulfilling the data-reporting requirements .
In that connection , the Ad Hoc Group of Experts on the Reporting of Data had identified several technical and administrative problems and their possible solutions .
It was suggested , inter alia , that import control by customs regulations , based on the Harmonized Commodity System , should be established .
However , in view of the difficulties that had been raised , the Committee supported the proposal from the Preparatory Meeting that Parties should insert further subdivisions to the recommended Harmonized System subheadings .
30 . She also called for high priority to be given to support for developing countries to help them fulfil their reporting duties .
Indeed , at the most recent meeting of the Implementation Committee , representatives from the Interim Multilateral Fund and the implementing agencies had been invited to inform the Committee about their programmes to assist Parties operating under Article 5 .
Since the Implementation Committee was very interested in close cooperation with the Fund and the implementing agencies and the work of those agencies was of crucial importance to the work of the Committee , it was essential for the Committee and the Fund to work closely together and exchange information on a regular basis .
4 . Report on the work of the Open-ended Working Group of
the Parties to the Montreal Protocol
31 . Mr. Lee-Bapty ( United Kingdom ) , Co-Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol , said that the report of the Legal Drafting Group ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 2 / Rev.1 ) , which was before the Meeting , reflected the outcome of the meetings of the Open-ended Working Group and their own drafting .
It was no surprise that the chemicals already controlled were those on which the greatest degree of consensus had been achieved .
For those that had become a subject of discussion more recently , there had been more to do .
In particular , methyl bromide was one substance where there was a need to balance its undoubted damage to the ozone layer with the vital applications for which it was undoubtedly needed .
The Group had not agreed whether to phase out or reduce all but quarantine and pre-shipment uses by the end of the century , or to be satisfied with a freeze until further research had been completed , or , indeed , to defer any controls until after that research .
It had , at least , identified how any one of those options could be reflected in the Protocol itself .
For hydrochlorofluorocarbons , the situation was still more complicated .
The Group had largely adopted the framework developed by the Executive Director and the group of experts he had convened and had abandoned the various individual proposals on the way .
It had agreed that there should be a consumption limit and had generally agreed on a reduction schedule .
What remained was to set the initial level and the final phase-out date and to consider the extent to which , for the first time , the Protocol could be used to influence the applications for which the chemicals were employed .
32 . One other important issue was the question of the application of new controls to Article 5 Parties .
It was generally accepted that the question of controls on hydrochlorofluorocarbons , hydrobromofluorocarbons and methyl bromide in developing countries should be decided on in 1995 .
5 . Report on the work of the Preparatory Meeting for the Fourth
Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol
on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer
33 . Mr. López ( Venezuela ) , Chairman of the Preparatory Meeting for the Fourth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer said that the work of the Preparatory Meeting had been extremely positive and more than expected had been achieved .
There were , however , still a number of outstanding issues .
He hoped that there could be further progress in the Open-ended Working Group so that any agreements could go , through the Preparatory Committee , to the Meeting of the Parties with no dissenting views .
In spite of the delay in completing its work , the Preparatory Meeting had been effective and productive in its endeavour to provide the Meeting of the Parties with proposals containing as few controversial issues as possible .
He therefore urged the Fourth Meeting of the Parties to adopt the draft decisions that would be submitted to it .
B. Statements
34 . Statements were then made by representatives of 54 States , including 3 non-Parties , by a regional economic grouping Party to the Protocol , and by 4 non-governmental organizations .
Discussion focused on the proposed amendments and adjustments to the Protocol , and the proposals regarding the financial mechanism .
35 . Nearly all the representatives who spoke expressed the view that the Montreal Protocol was an excellent example of international cooperation and provided a model for all subsequent international legal instruments relating to the environment .
Several of them noted that the endeavours to protect the ozone layer also constituted a positive contribution to the work being done elsewhere on global warming and climate change .
Several of them mentioned the need for programmes to sensitize public opinion to the seriousness of the problem of ozone-layer depletion .
36 . Many representatives of Parties gave accounts of the work already done in their countries to implement the Montreal Protocol and of the plans of action adopted and other future work programmes .
One representative referred , in particular , to the need for more observation stations to fill the data gaps .
37 . Virtually all the speakers stressed the serious need for additional data on the ozone layer , particularly in the light of the latest scientific information .
The representatives of countries situated in high latitudes were particularly concerned about that issue .
Depletion of the ozone layer was proceeding at an alarming rate , far faster than had been predicted , with possible hazardous consequences for human health and the environment .
Increases in surface UV-B radiation had actually been measured in both hemispheres .
And both hemispheres , &quot; holes &quot; in the ozone layer had been detected and were becoming larger every year .
38 . A number of representatives referred to the need for sustainable development , one of them adding that that meant paying careful attention to natural cycles in different environments .
Another representative stated that the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development had pointed the way to what might be described as a future environmental foreign policy , conducted by States through the United Nations .
Sustainable development , several representatives argued , meant changes in the behaviour of producers and , in particular , of consumers .
An example was given , in the context of the Montreal Protocol , that air-conditioning might be an essential use for controlled substances in one context and a mere luxury in another .
Luxury , and indeed comfort , that entailed damage to the environment would have to be renounced .
39 . Most of the representatives of developed countries were in favour of the proposed adjustments and Amendment , as a reasonable compromise between the different views expressed , though a number of them stated that they would have preferred earlier phase-out dates for the controlled substances than those proposed .
Several of the representatives of developed countries stressed the importance of securing the cooperation of industry , both in terms of the development of more benign chemicals and technologies and in implementing control measures .
One of them cautioned against making impossible demands on industry .
Most of the representatives of developed countries favoured a rapid phase-out of the transitional substances and the inclusion of methyl bromide in the Protocol as a controlled substance , since it was a known ozone-depleting substance .
Several representatives underlined the importance of recovery and recycling activities , with regard to both the replacement of new production and the reduction of emissions to the atmosphere .
40 . While most of the representatives of Parties operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , favoured , in principle , the more rapid phasing out of the controlled substances by the Parties not operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , they were concerned that exports of those substances should be guaranteed , at affordable prices , during their own grace and phase-out periods .
In that connection , many of them emphasized that there should be no automatic application of the new provisions to the countries operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , pending the 1995 review of the situation .
Most of them added that the inclusion of methyl bromide as a controlled substance in the Protocol could have serious effects on their economies .
One representative expressed the hope that the proposed new regulations , particularly with respect to methyl bromide , would not be used to establish non-tariff barriers to international trade .
One representative cautioned against the taking of hasty decisions which would endanger the fragile economies of the developing countries .
One representative of a Party stated that his delegation would have liked the Fourth Meeting to devote itself to revising the London Amendment rather than adopting new amendments .
41 . The proposed establishment of the Multilateral Fund was generally welcomed , many representatives stating that the Interim Multilateral Fund had proved its worth .
Many representatives expressed dismay at the fact that the payment of contributions to the Interim Multilateral Fund was seriously in arrears and urged that , if the payment of contributions to the financial mechanism was not already mandatory , it should become so .
Several representatives of Parties not operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , informed the Meeting that their countries &apos; contributions had just been paid .
42 . Some representatives expressed deep concern that certain countries were questioning the commitment made in London to establish the Multilateral Fund on a permanent basis and were unwilling to reaffirm their financial commitment to the Fund beyond 1993 .
They emphasized that the Fund was an essential element without which implementation of the Protocol would be meaningless .
One of them stated that his delegation viewed with great concern any attempt to alter the structure of the Fund .
It had currently a democratic character due to the governance by both developed and developing countries , and a change in that structure would be short-sighted and counter-productive .
43 . A number of representatives referred to the conditions for the transfer of technology , stating that the current situation was unsatisfactory .
Several of them stated that such transfer should be carried out on concessionary terms , while one considered that it should be free of charge .
44 . Another delegation drew the attention of the Parties to the lack of independent certification on the overall environmental acceptability of the growing list of alternatives that were alleged to be safe .
It urged the establishment of a legal regime for certification , product safety and liability for the alternatives before they could be marketed .
45 . Some representatives of Parties not operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , stated that their countries were encountering serious , but it was hoped transitory , economic difficulties .
They did not wish to become recipients of assistance from the Fund but they did need temporary exemption from certain of their obligations under the Protocol .
It was regrettable that the Parties appeared unwilling to recognize the existence of a third group of countries - those with economies in transition - as well as the two established groups of developed and developing countries .
46 . One of them added that his country had accepted the position of successor State to a previous multinational State that had fissured into its component parts .
Although that had meant a considerable reduction in its territory and population , there had been no recalculation of its assessed contribution .
A further complication was that most of the other successors to the previous multinational State were not Parties to the Protocol , with the result that what had previously been domestic transactions in controlled substances had become trade with non-Parties and would henceforth be governed by Article 4 .
However , if a preferential regime were established to meet those concerns , his delegation would not object to new and tightened controls .
47 . A number of representatives welcomed the proposed establishment of the non-compliance procedure , several of them noting that it could help to provide a solution to the problem of countries facing special difficulties , particularly transitory ones .
48 . The representative of Kuwait described the severe environmental impact arising as a result of the invasion and occupation of his country by Iraq .
Speaking in exercise of the right of reply , the representative of Iraq said that such extraneous political issues as those raised by the representative of Kuwait had no place in a technical meeting .
49 . The observer for a non-governmental organization said that the Montreal Protocol had been a great success for international diplomacy , at the cost of a great deal of hard work by many dedicated people .
Unfortunately , it had not been a success for the protection of the ozone layer .
Every year since 1987 the scientists had informed the world that actual ozone destruction was worse than expected .
The negotiation and renegotiation of the Protocol , held back by the dragging feet of industrial interests , had failed to match the urgency of the problem .
If HCFCs were used as a transitional product , as advocated by industry , it would significantly delay the recovery of the ozone layer .
Methyl bromide , a truly potent ozone destroyer , appeared likely to escape effective control .
Her own and other non-governmental organizations were doing their best , as were independent scientists and others , but there was a limit to their possibilities .
Only Governments could take effective action to remedy the situation at the eleventh hour , and she urged them to do so .
50 . The observer for another non-governmental organization said that all the Parties represented at the Meeting had committed themselves to halting the depletion of the ozone layer , and the peoples of the world expected them to honour those commitments .
That was not the result the peoples of the world expected , and he appealed to the Meeting to find the political will to rid the world of all the chemicals destroying its protective ozone layer .
51 . The observer for a third non-governmental organization said it would be useful if the non-governmental organizations concerned with the environment were represented on the assessment panels .
He felt sure that such representation would give the panels a valuable new dimension .
52 . The observer for a fourth non-governmental organization reported a 30 per cent reduction in CFCs in one area of one country to meet the objectives of the Protocol , and requested that its data on controlled substances be recorded and made available to the Parties .
53 . The representative of one country said that the observer should not have referred to the data from a province of that country .
That province was , of course , like all other provinces of that country , bound by the Montreal Protocol , since the country was a Party thereto .
However , he was unable to accept the establishment of direct relations between a province of one country and the Secretariat of the Montreal Protocol , UNEP or , indeed , any other organ dealing with the environment .
The correct procedure was for the authorities to forward their data to the Government of that country for incorporation in the overall data of the country , which would then be forwarded to the Secretariat .
C. Action by the Meeting
54 . Under agenda items 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 , the Meeting had before it the report of the Executive Director ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 5 and Add.1 ) , the report of the Secretariat on information provided by the Parties in accordance with Articles 4 , 7 and 9 ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 6 and Corr.1 and Add.1 ) , the report of the Implementation Committee ( UNEP / OzL.Pro / ImpCom / 3 / 3 ) , the report of the Executive Committee of the Interim Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 8 / Rev.1 and Add.1 ) , a report by the Executive Committee on meeting the needs of Article 5 Parties for controlled substances during the grace and phase-out periods ( UNEP / OzL.Pro / ExCom / 8 / 25 and Add.1 ) , the revised budget for 1992 and 1993 , the proposed initial budget for 1994 ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 7 ) , financial reports on the Trust Fund for the Montreal Protocol and on the Interim Secretariat for the Vienna Convention and its Montreal Protocol ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 9 ) , and a note regarding the Harmonized System customs code numbers for the products listed in Annex D of the amended Montreal Protocol ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 3 and Corr.1 ) .
It also had before it a note by the Executive Director on further adjustments and amendment to the Montreal Protocol ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 10 and Corr.1 and Add.1 ) , a note by the Executive Director on contributions to the Interim Multilateral Fund ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 13 and Corr.1 ) , draft decisions ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / L.1 / Rev.1 ) , the report of the Legal Drafting Group prepared during the eighth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / 2 / Rev.1 ) , the report of the eighth meeting of the Open-ended Working Group of the Parties ( UNEP / OzL.Pro / WG.1 / 8 / 2 ) and the report of the Preparatory Meeting ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.4 / Prep / 2 ) , and the reports of the first and second meetings of the Bureau of the Third Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol ( UNEP / OzL.Pro.3 / Bur / 1 / 3 and UNEP / OzL.Pro.3 / Bur / 2 / 3 ) .

Decision IV / 25 .
Essential uses
1 . To apply the following criteria and procedure in assessing an essential use for the purposes of control measures in Article 2 of the Protocol :
( a ) That a use of a controlled substance should qualify as &quot; essential &quot; only if :
( i ) It is necessary for the health , safety or is critical for the functioning of society ( encompassing cultural and intellectual aspects ) ; and
( ii ) There are no available technically and economically feasible alternatives or substitutes that are acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health ;
( b ) That production and consumption , if any , of a controlled substance for essential uses should be permitted only if :
( i ) All economically feasible steps have been taken to minimize the essential use and any associated emission of the controlled substance ; and
( ii ) The controlled substance is not available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked or recycled controlled substances , also bearing in mind the developing countries &apos; need for controlled substances ;

4 . To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel , while making its recommendations to take into account the environmental acceptability , health effects , economic feasibility , availability , and regulatory status of alternatives and substitutes ;
5 . To request the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel to submit its report , through the Secretariat , at least three months before the Meeting of the Parties in which a decision is to be taken .
The subsequent reports will also consider which previously qualified essential uses should no longer qualify as essential ;
6 . To request the Open-ended Working Group of the Parties to consider the report of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel and make its recommendations to the Fifth Meeting of the Parties for halons and at the Sixth Meeting for all other substances for which an essential use is proposed ;
7 . That essential use controls will not be applicable to Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol until the phase-out dates applicable to those Parties ;
Decision IV / 26 .
1 . To urge Parties to encourage recovery , recycling and reclamation of halons in order to meet the needs of all Parties , particularly those operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol ;
2 . To call upon Parties importing recovered or recycled substances in Group II of Annex A to apply , when deciding on the use of those substances , the essential-use criteria set out in the 1991 report of the Halons Technical Options Committee .
The purpose of these criteria is to minimize the use of halons in non-essential applications ;
3 .

4 . To request the Executive Committee to estimate , on an ongoing basis , the amount of HCFCs required by Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article 5 of the Protocol and to recommend the methods of meeting such needs in full , simultaneously with the exercise to estimate the amounts of controlled substances needed , as well as to estimate the production available to meet those needs , as requested by the Open-ended Working Group at its seventh meeting ;
Decision IV / 31 .
Fifth Meeting of the Parties to the
Montreal Protocol
- To convene the Fifth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in October / November 1993 .
57 . The Meeting further decided to extend the mandate of the Open-ended Working Group of the Parties to consider the issues referred to it by the Fourth Meeting of the Parties .
58 . It was proposed , and accepted by the Meeting , that Mr. John Carstenssen , a representative of Denmark , should serve as Co-Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group in replacement of Mr. Steve Lee-Bapty of the United Kingdom .
The Meeting endorsed the selection of Denmark and Mexico as Co-Chairmen of the Open-ended Working Group of the Parties .
59 . The Meeting noted that , in future , each assessment panel was to have three Co-Chairmen , of which one should be from a developing country .
Following the nominations of the regional groups concerned , the Meeting decided that Mr. Au Camp ( South Africa ) should serve as Co-Chairman of the Scientific Assessment Panel , Mr. A. Cvijac ( Brazil ) as Co-Chairman of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel , and Mr. Tan Xiao Yan ( China ) as Co-Chairman of the Environmental Effects Panel .
The Meeting also decided that Mr. L. Kuijpers ( Netherlands ) would replace Mr. S. Lee-Bapty as a Co-Chairman of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel .
The Meeting placed on record its appreciation of the services of Mr. Lee-Bapty as a Co-Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group as well as of the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel .
60 . It was further agreed that Mr. Banks ( Australia ) would serve as Chairman of the Methyl Bromide Technical Options Committee and Mr. Y. Fujimoto ( Japan ) would act as Senior Adviser on the Solvents Technical Options Committee .
Decision IV / 4 ( &quot; Further Amendment of the Protocol &quot; )
61 . The Meeting agreed that the figure in paragraph 1 ( a ) of the proposed Article 2F in the draft Amendment should be three point one and that the date in paragraph 2 of the same Article should be 2004 .
62 . The text of the proposed Article 2 in the draft Amendment was adopted with the addition of a sentence at the end to provide for exemption for quarantine and pre-shipment applications , as had already been agreed by the Parties .
Some delegations reiterated their reservations on listing methyl bromide as a controlled substance in view of the scientific uncertainty regarding the substance , even though they did not wish to block consensus on the issue .
Some other delegations felt that the amendment regarding that substance was not adequate even though they also supported the consensus .
Regarding the ozone-depleting potential of methyl bromide , some delegations felt that it should not be mentioned as 0.7 in the proposed Annex E in view of the uncertainties on that issue even though they , too , did not wish to block the consensus view that it should be mentioned .
63 . With regard to the proposed amendment to Article 5 , paragraph 1 , of the draft Amendment , the representative of Malaysia expressed the opinion that , any further Amendments to adjustments or Amendments adopted at London should only apply to Article 5 , paragraph 1 Parties after the 1995 review .
If at that time these Parties ratified the Copenhagen Amended Protocol , they would not be considered &quot; state not Party &quot; referred to in Article 4 , as the Copenhagen Amendment allowed them not to be bound by the further control measures referred above for the controlled substances concerned .
64 . The Chairman of the Legal Drafting Group , speaking in a personal capacity , gave the following informal view of the meaning of paragraph 9 of Article 4 of the Protocol .
65 . That paragraph defined &quot; a State not party to this Protocol &quot; to include a State or regional economic integration organization that had not agreed to be bound by the control measures in effect for a specified substance .
Thus , where a Party to the Protocol , as adopted in Montreal , did not agree to be bound by an Amendment that specified a control measure , it would appear to be a non-Party for the purposes of Article 4 where that control measure was concerned .
The fact of a Party being an Article 5 , paragraph 1 , country and thus being entitled to delay its compliance with the control measures , would not mean that it was &quot; a State not party to the Protocol &quot; .
Such a country was in every sense a party to the Protocol provisions by which it was bound with all the rights and obligations of a Party within its category .
66 . The Chairman of the Legal Drafting Group recalled that interpretation of the Protocol was primarily a matter for the Parties themselves and that no individual or group was in a position to provide authoritative legal opinions on the text .
67 . No objections were raised to the statement made by the Chairman of the Legal Drafting Group .
Some delegations stated that there were differing interpretations regarding the implications of the amendment to Article 5 , paragraph 1 .
On the suggestion of two delegations , the Meeting agreed that the first letter of the word &quot; Amendments &quot; as it appeared in the first line of the draft amendment to Article 5 , paragraph 1 , should be in lower case .
68 . The representative of Switzerland stated that the addition to Article 5 , paragraph 1 , was contrary to the principle of common but differentiated responsibility accepted by all the countries in the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .
The London Amendment already contained safeguards , such as a grace period and review procedure , to take account of the legitimate concerns of the countries operating under that paragraph .
Decision IV / 5 ( &quot; Non-compliance procedure &quot; )
Decision IV / 6 ( &quot; Implementation Committee &quot; )
70 . The Meeting agreed to select Argentina , Austria , Bulgaria , Republic of Korea and Uganda as members of the Implementation Committee for a two-year period , in addition to confirming the positions of Chile , Cameroon , Thailand , Russian Federation and the United States of America for one more year .
Decision IV / 16 ( &quot; Annex D to the Montreal Protocol &quot; )
71 . Draft decision IV / 15 , as amended on the proposal of one delegation , was adopted by the Meeting as decision IV / 16 .
Decision IV / 17 B ( &quot; Application to Colombia of paragraph 8 of Article 4 of the amended Montreal Protocol &quot; )
72 . After the adoption of decision IV / 17 B , the representative of Colombia expressed his gratitude to all those who had helped realize his country &apos;s aspirations .
Colombia intended to expedite the ratification procedures and hoped to participate in the next Meeting as a Party to the Protocol .
Decision IV / 17 C ( &quot; Application of trade measures under Article 4 to non-Parties to the Protocol &quot; )
73 . One delegation expressed the view that it was problematic to deviate from the text of the Protocol by means of a simple decision .
It hoped that decision would not create a precedent .
74 . Another delegation expressed the view that the decision should not be considered to be an exception to the text of the Protocol but , rather , a provisional interpretation .
Decision IV / 18 ( &quot; Financial Mechanism &quot; ) , section I
75 . The Meeting decided to remove the square brackets in paragraph 3 of draft decision IV / 17 , which became section I of decision IV / 18 .
Decision IV / 20 ( &quot; Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund &quot; )
76 . Draft decision IV / 19 , as orally corrected by the Secretariat , was adopted as decision IV / 20 .
77 . With regard to the scale of contributions adopted for the Multilateral Fund , the delegation of the Republic of Korea stated that it could not accept the classification of its country as not operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , on the basis of old and out-of-date data for the year 1989 .
The data for Korea for 1992 would be submitted officially to the Secretariat by the end of September 1993 , as stipulated in Article 7 .
Pending submission of those data , the Republic of Korea should be classified as temporarily operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 .
78 . The Secretariat , in response to the statement made by the representative of the Republic of Korea , clarified that a developing country qualified as a Party operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 , if its consumption in the year when the Protocol entered into force for it was less than the limits specified in Article 5 , paragraph 1 .
The Republic of Korea , prior to its ratification of the Protocol , had submitted data for 1989 to the Secretariat in connection with its claim that it should be treated as a Party operating under Article 2 , paragraph 6 , of the Protocol , and had resubmitted it in 1991 showing that its consumption was much above the limit specified in Article 5 , paragraph 1 .
The Secretariat , therefore , had been unable to classify the Republic of Korea as a Party operating under Article 5 , paragraph 1 .
If information received in the future showed that the Republic of Korea qualified for such a classification , the Secretariat would reclassify it accordingly .
Decision IV / 26 ( &quot; International recycled halon bank management &quot; )
79 . Draft decision IV / 25 was adopted as decision IV / 26 with corrections introduced orally by the representatives of India and Canada .
Decision IV / 30 ( &quot; Hydrochlorofluorocarbons ( HCFCs &quot; ) )
80 . Draft decision IV / 28 bis was adopted as decision IV / 30 with a correction introduced orally by the representative of Brazil .
Annexes XI and XIV

On the proposal of France , the Meeting agreed that a further column should be included in the scale of contributions contained in annexes XI and XIV to the report of the Meeting to show the existing United Nations scale of assessments for the sake of comparison with the scale already appearing in the draft annexes , which was the one being recommended to the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session by the Committee on Contributions .
Statements made in explanation of position
82 . Following the adoption of the decisions , the representative of the Russian Federation said that his country supported the efforts of the world community to phase out ozone-deleting substances and was prepared to contribute to the achievement of that goal .
It was , however , experiencing extraordinary political , economic and social difficulties and did not have the capacity to assume the additional obligations under the new amendments and adjustments to the Montreal Protocol .
It would direct all available resources towards the replacement of ozone-depleting substances and technology in its industry and therefore could not undertake guaranteed obligations with respect to financial participation in the Multilateral Fund for the Montreal Protocol .
The Russian Federation would not object to the new amendments and adjustments to the Montreal Protocol , if - and only if - it was granted a specific preferential regime in the Protocol &apos;s implementation .
83 . The representative of Guyana said that the generosity shown to countries not in compliance with the Protocol was a good example of the global partnership that was required if the spirit of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development was to be fulfilled .
V. RESOLUTIONS
84 . At the closing session , on 25 November 1992 , the Parties adopted a resolution on methyl bromide as proposed orally by the President and amended by Israel .
The text of the resolution is attached as annex XV to the present report .

Atmospheric releases of ODS shall be monitored at all facilities with air emission discharges ( where applicable ) to ensure compliance with the recommendations of the report of the ad hoc Technical Advisory Committee on Destruction Technologies .
INDICATIVE LIST OF CATEGORIES OF INCREMENTAL COSTS
1 . The evaluation of requests for financing incremental costs of a given project shall take into account the following general principles :
( a ) The most cost-effective and efficient option should be chosen , taking into account the national industrial strategy of the recipient party .
It should be considered carefully to what extent the infrastructure at present used for production of the controlled substances could be put to alternative uses , thus resulting in decreased capital abandonment , and how to avoid deindustrialization and loss of export revenues ;
( b ) Consideration of project proposals for funding should involve the careful scrutiny of cost items listed in an effort to ensure that there is no double-counting ;
( c ) Savings or benefits that will be gained at both the strategic and project levels during the transition process should be taken into account on a case-by-case basis , according to criteria decided by the Parties and as elaborated in the guidelines of the Executive Committee ;
( d ) The funding of incremental costs is intended as an incentive for early adoption of ozone protecting technologies .
In this respect the Executive Committee shall agree which time scales for payment of incremental costs are appropriate in each sector .
2 . Incremental costs that once agreed are to be met by the financial mechanism include those listed below .
If incremental costs other than those mentioned below are identified and quantified , a decision as to whether they are to be met by the financial mechanism shall be taken by the Executive Committee consistent with any criteria decided by the Parties and elaborated in the guidelines of the Executive Committee .
The incremental recurring costs apply only for a transition period to be defined .
The following list is indicated :
( a ) Supply of substitutes
( i ) Cost of conversion of existing production facilities :
- cost of patents and designs and incremental cost of royalties ;
- capital cost of conversion ;
- cost of retraining of personnel , as well as the cost of research to adapt technology to local circumstances ;
( ii ) Costs arising from premature retirement or enforced idleness , taking into account any guidance of the Executive Committee on appropriate cut-off dates :
- where such capacity is not replaced by converted or new capacity to produce alternatives ;
( iii ) Cost of establishing new production facilities for substitutes of capacity equivalent to capacity lost when plants are converted or scrapped , including :
- capital cost ;
- cost of training , as well as the cost of research to adapt technology to local circumstances ;
( iv ) Net operational cost , including the cost of raw materials ;
( v ) Cost of import of substitutes ;
( b ) Use in manufacturing as an intermediate good
( i ) Cost of conversion of existing equipment and product manufacturing facilities ;
( ii ) Cost of patents and designs and incremental cost of royalties ;
( iii ) Capital cost ;
( iv ) Cost of retraining ;
( v ) Cost of research and development ;
( vi ) Operational cost , including the cost of raw materials except where otherwise provided for ;
( c ) End use
( i ) Cost of premature modification or replacement of user equipment ;
( ii ) Cost of collection , management , recycling , and , if cost effective , destruction of ozone-depleting substances ;
( iii ) Cost of providing technical assistance to reduce consumption and unintended emission of ozone-depleting substances .

Programme support cost ( 13 % ) 329 355 299 390 376 090
( a ) The Deputy Secretary will join the Secretariat effective 2 July 1992 .
The budget has accordingly been adjusted to US $ 48,000 from US $ 96,000 .
( b ) There is a need for consultancy assistance to analyse the data received .
Some non-Parties who are intending to ratify the Protocol have requested assistance to understand the Protocol and to collect their data regarding the ozone depleting substances in preparation for ratifying the Montreal Protocol .
Provision is made for the consultancy months to cover these requirements .
The amount is already provided for in the budgets for 1992 and 1993 , approved by the Third Meeting of the Parties in June 1991 .
( c ) The Secretariat receives about 2,500 letters and sends out about 5,000 letters every year to Governments , universities , individuals , non-governmental organizations , and other UN offices .
This is in addition to the correspondence handled by the Conference Services Unit of UNEP .
This correspondence needs to be filed regularly in about 300 files .
In addition , the Secretariat organizes and coordinates on average one meeting every month , i.e. 12 meetings a year .
These require , preparation and dispatch of many documents in 6 UN languages to all concerned recipients .
There have been continuous requests for documents by Governments , organizations and experts .
This leads to a significant growth in the handling of documents , in volume and complexity .
There is , therefore , a need for a documents clerk at level G-5 to maintain the files and records for reference and inventory purposes .
He / She will also assist in the follow-up regarding reproduction and despatch of ozone documents .
The clerk will be employed from 1 January 1993 .
( d ) $ US 5,000 provided in view of the many meetings in 1992 and 1993 .
No budget has been allocated for this by the Third Meeting .
( e ) The conference servicing costs are calculated as follows :
1992 : The costs are kept at the same level as approved by the Third Meeting of the Parties , except that the costs for the Working Group Meetings have gone up from US $ 175,000 to US $ 400,000 for each meeting .
The reason for this increase is that the provision in the approved budget estimate was for a meeting of three days each , whereas the actual meetings were of 8 days duration each .
The increase in the number of days was necessitated by the many issues referred to the Working Group .
1993 : There is a new provision of $ 5,000 ( for servicing Assessment Panel meetings ) not provided for in the budget estimates approved by the Third Meeting of the Parties for 1993 .
Such Panel meetings were not anticipated earlier .
- The two Working Group Meetings in six languages and five days are assumed to be in Nairobi and will employ the same number of non-local personnel as for the Meeting of the Parties .
- The two Bureau Meetings , each in three languages , will be held in Nairobi for two days .
- The four Committee Meetings will be held in Nairobi in English .
- The two Informal Consultations will be held in Nairobi in English .
- The extent of documentation for meetings is assumed to be the same as in 1993 .
( f ) Provision is made for fifteen lots of travel by the Secretariat staff in 1993 and 1994 .
Five lots of travel per year of the UNEP Conference Services staff are provided to service various ozone meetings .
The travel budget for 1993 is the same as approved by the Third Meeting of the Parties .
( g ) Participation cost of developing countries is worked out as follows :
1992 : $ US 5,000 per participant has been used as the basis for travel and per diem allowances for participation in meetings lasting for one week .
The only change from the budget approved by the Third Meeting of the Parties is the provision of $ US 100,000 for participation in the meetings regarding Methyl Bromide and Halons , as decided by the Sixth Meeting of the Open-Ended Working Group .
Earlier , it was not anticipated that there would be any Assessment panel meetings in 1992 .
1993 : The cost of participation ( travel and subsistence ) of one delegate is estimated at $ US 6,000 per week .
For the meeting of the Parties , the duration is assumed to be 1.5 weeks , including the duration of the Conference of the Parties to the Vienna Convention .
The costs are shared between the Preparatory Meetings , the Conference of the Parties to Vienna Convention and the Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol .
The only change from the budget approved by the Third Meeting of the Parties is the provision of $ US 240,000 for participation of about 40 experts from developing countries in assessment panel meetings on Methyl Bromide , Halons and essential uses , as called for by the proposed adjustments and Amendment .
1994 : The cost of participation of one expert in one meeting for one week is estimated at $ US 6,500 .
( h ) An estimated cost of office expendables ; the amounts are already provided for in the budget for 1992 and 1993 , approved by the Third Meeting of the Parties .
( i ) It is proposed to buy four more personal computers at a cost of $ US 6,000 , a portable computer at a cost of $ US 3,000 , and a laser printer at a cost of $ US 5,000 in 1992 .
This is to equip the Coordinator , Deputy Coordinator , the Administrative Officer and a Secretary with personal computers .
This is already provided for in the approved budget for 1992 by the Third Meeting of the Parties .
( j ) 4301 Rental of Premises :
- Due to the shortage of office space at UNEP Headquarters , the Secretariat was temporarily moved to rented accommodation , effective 4 November 1991 .
Hence , an additional budget line has been introduced .
- The Secretariat will move back to UNEP Headquarters as soon as the new blocks are completed , but rent will be charged as per UN norms .
This has not been included in the budgets approved by the Third Meeting for 1992 and 1993 .
( k ) The estimates are based on existing UNEP maintenance contracts .
This is already provided for in the budgets for 1992 and 1993 , approved by the Third Meeting of the Parties .
( l ) The reporting cost for 1992 includes printing and distribution of the Assessment Panel reports for which there is great demand .
Hence an additional provision of $ US 45,000 is made .
The provision for 1993 is the same as approved by the Third Meeting of the Parties .
The costs for 1993 and 1994 for general reporting are for reporting on the Ozone meetings .
In addition , in 1994 provision is made for printing and distribution of reports of Assessment Panels on Methyl Bromide , Halons , essential uses , etc .
( m ) For 1992 and 1993 the freight charges have been increased by $ 45,000 and $ 10,000 respectively over the earlier estimate approved by the Third Meeting of the Parties , based on actual experience .
An estimate has been made for 1994 .
( n ) The 1992 and 1993 provision approved by the Third Meetings of the Parties has been reduced .
( o ) The contingency allowance has been removed in 1992 , and in 1993 and 1994 has been left at $ 100,000 as had been estimated in the past .

Annex XVI
QUESTION OF YUGOSLAVIA
Statement by the representative of the United Kingdom on behalf
of the European Community *
&quot; As we have already made clear on a number of occasions , the European Community and its member States do not accept that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is the automatic continuation of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
&quot; In this context , we take note of General Assembly resolution 47 / 1 , adopted on 22 September 1992 , in which the Assembly considered that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations , and decided that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) should therefore apply to join the United Nations and shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly .
&quot; The European Community and its member States have also noted the United Nations Legal Counsel &apos;s advice on the applicability of the General Assembly resolution to other United Nations bodies .
We regard General Assembly resolution 47 / 1 as a model for action in the specialized agencies and other United Nations bodies in due course , as appropriate .
&quot; We do not accept that representatives of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) may validly represent Yugoslavia in this meeting .
The presence of the representative in question is without prejudice to future action which the Community and its member States may take . &quot;
Statement by the representative of Yugoslavia
&quot; We are sorry about the statements of some countries raising the question of the status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .
We would like to stress that this approach as well as the imposed sanctions against Yugoslavia are essentially contrary to the basic premises of both the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol .
&quot; This conference is devoted to the protection of the ozone layer , a question of global character and raising political issues does not help in reaching the goals of this meeting .
&quot; Yugoslavia respects the resolutions of the United Nations .
Yugoslavia does not participate , we hope temporarily , in the meetings of the General Assembly , but Yugoslavia is not expelled from the United Nations and its bodies and works intensively to fulfil their goals .
&quot; At the same time we would like to give our positive contribution to the work of this conference , aware of the fact that it is of global and our own interest . &quot;

GENERAL ASSEMBLY SECURITY COUNCIL
Forty-seventh session Forty-eighth year
Agenda item 22
THE SITUATION OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN HAITI
Report of the Secretary-General
1 . The present report is a follow-up to the report dated 12 July 1993 ( A / 47 / 975-S / 26063 ) by which the Secretary-General informed the Security Council of the signature of the Governors Island Agreement .
It is being submitted in pursuance of paragraph 15 of Security Council resolution 841 ( 1993 ) of 16 June 1993 , in which the Council requested the Secretary-General to report to it on progress achieved in the efforts jointly undertaken by him and the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) with a view to reaching a political solution to the crisis Haiti .
2 . Following the signature of the Governors Island Agreement on 3 July 1993 , Mr. Dante Caputo , the Special Envoy of the Secretaries-General of the United Nations and OAS , invited the representatives of the main political forces in Haiti and of the political blocs in Parliament to participate , together with the members of the Presidential Commission which represents President Aristide in Haiti , at a political dialogue to discuss the agenda set forth in point 1 of the Governors Island Agreement .
3 . The inter-Haitian political dialogue convened at United Nations Headquarters from 14 to 16 July 1993 .
At its conclusion the participants signed a new document , known as the New York Pact , which provides for a political truce of six months &apos; duration , a procedure to enable Parliament to resume its normal functioning , and agreements for the early confirmation of the Prime Minister nominated by the President to head a Government of national concord , and for the adoption of the legal instruments necessary for ensuring the transition . ( The text of the New York Pact is reproduced in the annex to the present report . )
4 . Under the Pact , the political forces and parliamentary blocs have undertaken inter alia to refrain from tabling in Parliament any motion of no-confidence against the new Government of national concord , to secure the immediate release of all persons detained for offences relating to their views ( délits d &apos;opinion ) and to have the status of prisoners reviewed , to promote the establishment of a Compensation Commission for the victims of the coup d &apos;état , and to ensure the confirmation of the new Prime Minister without delay .

5 . The signatories of the Pact have also undertaken to ensure the passage by Parliament of a series of bills under an emergency procedure , including those regarding the establishment of a new police force , an amnesty , the abolition of all paramilitary forces , the establishment of a Citizens &apos; Protection Bureau , and the reform of the administration of justice system .
6 . The Pact reaffirms the right of the Executive , within the framework of its powers , to review the various decrees and orders adopted in the period from 30 September 1991 to 3 July 1993 that are not in accordance with the Constitution , in particular , the order setting up the Permanent Emergency Electoral Council .
7 . As regards the 13 Members of Parliament who derived their mandate from the partial elections held on 18 January 1993 , which had been declared illegitimate by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 20 B of 20 April 1993 and by the Permanent Council of OAS , it was agreed that they should voluntarily refrain from occupying their parliamentary seats until such time as the Conciliation Commission , an organ established under the Constitution but whose functioning requires the adoption by Parliament of a law under the emergency procedure , had definitively pronounced itself on the matter .
8 . It is the understanding of the Secretary-General that the formula agreed to under paragraph 6 of the Pact signifies that the members of the Senate and of the Chamber of Deputies who derive their mandate from the contested elections of 18 January 1993 are to abstain from participating in any business of the Parliament , including intervention in the debate and voting .
Failure to comply with this formula would constitute , in his view , a serious breach of the Governors Island Agreement , which would be immediately reported to the Security Council .
The Secretary-General further considers that the decision to refer the matter to the Conciliation Commission is not based upon any finding that there exists any conflict between the Executive and the Legislature or between the two Chambers of Parliament , but is a product of a political agreement to overcome an exceptional crisis .
During the political dialogue , the Special Envoy repeated that the position of the United Nations with regard to the legitimacy of the January elections remained unchanged .
9 . The undertakings enshrined in the Pact , like all agreements arrived at under the Governors Island Agreement , are subject to verification by the United Nations and by OAS .
11 . On 24 July 1993 , President Jean-Bertrand Aristide informed the Presidents of the two Chambers of Parliament of his intention to nominate Mr. Robert Malval as Prime Minister .
A new bureau was elected in the Chamber of Deputies on 22 and 28 July and in the Senate on 10 August .
With the normalization of Parliament , the way has been cleared for the ratification of the Prime Minister .
When the new Prime Minister receives a vote of confidence from the two Chambers of Parliament , the three first points in the Governors Island Agreement will have been duly carried out .
12 . As soon as the Prime Minister has taken office , the Secretary-General , as proposed in his previous report ( A / 47 / 975-S / 26063 ) and agreed in the letter addressed to him by the President of the Security Council on 15 July 1993 ( S / 26085 ) , will recommend to the Security Council that the sanctions it imposed by resolution 841 ( 1993 ) should immediately be suspended .
The suspension will automatically be terminated and sanctions reimposed if at any time he , having regard to the view of the Secretary-General of OAS , reports to the Council that the parties to the Governors Island Agreement or any authorities in Haiti have failed to comply in good faith with the Agreement .
Some of the circumstances which would lead the Secretary-General to conclude that such a breach had occurred are spelt out in paragraph 8 above and in paragraph 11 of his previous report .

Deployment of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus ,
May 1993 . 37
I. INTRODUCTION
The Security Council , in its resolution 186 ( 1964 ) of 4 March 1964 ( S / 5575 ) , recommended that the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus ( UNFICYP ) be established and that the Force be stationed for a period of three months with a mandate to use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of fighting , and , as necessary , to contribute to the maintenance and restoration of law and order and a return to normal conditions .
The Council also recommended that all costs pertaining to the Force should be met in a manner to be agreed upon by the Governments providing the contingents and by the Government of Cyprus .
The Secretary-General was also authorized to accept voluntary contributions for that purpose .
Thus , UNFICYP became unique among United Nations peace-keeping operations in depending on voluntary contributions to meet the cost of its operation .
The United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus became operational on 27 March 1964 .
During the first four years of the Force , mandate extensions by the Security Council were mostly for three-month periods .
Thereafter , the mandate of UNFICYP has been extended for six-month periods , the latest of which was extended by Security Council resolution 839 ( 1993 ) of 11 June 1993 from 16 June to 15 December 1993 .
The present report sets out the operational plan of the Force , and the cost estimates for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 16 June to 15 December 1993 .
It also provides the historical background for the period from inception through 15 June 1993 on the financing of the Force , its financial administration , the voluntary contributions received and the status of reimbursements due to troop-contributing countries .
II . OPERATIONAL PLAN
The Security Council , in its resolution 831 ( 1993 ) of 27 May 1993 decided that UNFICYP should be restructured to a strength of three infantry battalions of approximately 350 personnel each , the minimum number required to maintain effective control of the buffer zone , with the addition of a limited number of military observers for reconnaissance .
The operational plan for UNFICYP , at the present stage , as called for by Council resolution 831 ( 1993 ) , is described below .
The main headquarters of the mission , which was located at Nicosia since the inception of UNFICYP , will continue to be based in the United Nations Protected Area , Nicosia .
For operational purposes , UNFICYP will be divided into three sectors and six line companies .
Until recently , the three sectors were covered by battalions provided by Austria , Canada and the United Kingdom , with each battalion comprising two line companies together with headquarters and first line support .
The Canadian battalion has since withdrawn and a replacement battalion of some 350 personnel , to be drawn from a new troop-contributor , is expected to arrive by 1 September 1993 .
It is envisaged that Sector West will be responsible for the area from Kokkina to the Ovgos River .
Sector Centre will be responsible for the area covering Nicosia and Sector East will be responsible for the area from Nicosia to the east coast .
An armoured squadron and a helicopter flight unit will be based in the United Nations Protected Area .
The main functions of the Force have been to maintain the military status quo and to use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of fighting .
These functions will continue and under normal conditions , they will be carried out through the use of permanent and temporary observation posts along with helicopter , vehicle and foot patrols in the buffer zone .
In addition , UNFICYP also conducts , supervises as necessary , encourages and facilitates such humanitarian and economic activities that may be considered &quot; civilian activity &quot; and which in no way could contribute to confrontation or to a violation of the military status quo .
UNFICYP is in the process of being restructured as the first step on the basis of the proposal by the Secretary-General in his report of 30 March 1993 , 1 / paragraphs 16-19 .
The cease-fire lines extend approximately 180 kilometres from Kokkina enclave and Kato Pyrgos on the north-west coast to the east coast south of Farmagusta in the area of Dherinia .
The total area between the cease-fire lines , the width of which varies from 20 metres to 7 kilometres , covers about 3 per cent of the island .
In addition , UNFICYP is required to maintain effective liaison with both sides at all levels .
In order for UNFICYP to achieve the tasks set for the mission and to be able to control the buffer zone , a minimum strength of at least six companies on the cease-fire line is required .
The current authorized troop strength of the Force is 1,323 and consists of infantry personnel ( 1,050 ) , support personnel ( 223 ) , including 37 military personnel forming the headquarters unit , civilian police ( 38 ) and military observers ( 12 ) .
The civilian police are provided by Australia and Sweden and are based in five stations across the island .
Their main functions are :
To investigate criminal or other matters having inter-communal connotations or the possibility of political escalation ;
To provide support as required for the prevention of civil disorder within the buffer zone ;
To maintain liaison with civilian police from both communities ;
To support directly the humanitarian activities of UNFICYP in two main sectors .
The military observers are provided by Austria , Ireland and Hungary . The main function of the observers is for liaison and reconnaissance .
As decided by the Security Council in its resolution 831 ( 1993 ) , a comprehensive reassessment of UNFICYP will be carried out with a view to further restructuring , at the time of the consideration of the Force &apos;s mandate in December 1993 .
That reassessment will include an evaluation of progress made in the area of confidence-building towards a political settlement .
III . COST ESTIMATE FOR THE PERIOD FROM 16 JUNE
TO 15 DECEMBER 1993
It is estimated that the cost of maintaining UNFICYP for the current mandate period of six months from 16 June to 15 December 1993 is $ 21,512,000 gross ( $ 21,153,300 net ) .
Annex I to the present report sets out by budget line item a summary of the estimated costs , and supplementary information thereon is presented in annex II .
IV . PREVIOUS FINANCING OF THE UNITED NATIONS PEACE-KEEPING
FORCE IN CYPRUS
In paragraph 6 of its resolution 186 ( 1964 ) , the Security Council recommended that the costs of UNFICYP should be met by the Governments providing contingents , by the Government of Cyprus in accordance with article 19 of the Status of the Force Agreement , 2 / and by voluntary contributions to UNFICYP .
Appeals for voluntary contributions for the financing of UNFICYP , addressed to all Member States of the United Nations and to members of the specialized agencies , were issued by the Secretary-General twice a year .
However , the receipts from the appeals for voluntary contributions have never been sufficient to meet the United Nations share of the cost of UNFICYP based on the financial arrangements agreed between the United Nations and the troop-contributing Governments .
The Secretary-General considered it essential that action should be taken immediately to obtain the additional financial support required for the continuing maintenance of the Force .
It therefore became necessary for the Secretary-General to undertake a special effort to try to improve the financial situation of UNFICYP by making certain high-level approaches to a number of Governments which had not yet contributed to the UNFICYP account or which might give consideration to an increase in their contributions .
The Security Council , by its resolution 682 ( 1990 ) of 21 December 1990 , decided to examine the problem of the costs and financing of UNFICYP in all its aspects , bearing in mind the financial crisis facing the Force and the report of the Secretariat Review Team of 7 December 1990 . 6 /
The report of the Secretariat Review Team had made proposals for further reducing the costs of UNFICYP , but had also indicated that these proposals would only be possible if accompanied by a move to assessed contributions .
In its resolution 682 ( 1990 ) , the Council also decided to report , by 1 June 1991 , on alternative arrangements for meeting the costs of the Force for which the United Nations was responsible .
Between April and June 1991 , there was a series of informal meetings of the members of the Group of Friends of the President of the Security Council to consider the implications of Security Council resolution 682 ( 1990 ) .
The group concluded that those countries that had not yet accepted the case for assessed contributions would need to be persuaded that the costs of UNFICYP would be kept to a minimum .
In paragraph 3 of its resolution 698 ( 1991 ) of 14 June 1991 , the Council requested the Secretary-General to hold consultations with members of the Council , troop-contributing countries and others concerned , on the question of costs , taking into account both the report of the United Nations Secretariat Review Team of 7 December 1990 and the report of the Group of Friends of the President of the Security Council of 31 May 1991 .
The Security Council further requested the Secretary-General to report to the Council by 1 October 1991 and undertook to decide on measures to be taken to put the Force onto a sound and secure financial basis .
However , on 12 December 1991 , following the extension of UNFICYP for a further six-month period ending 15 June 1992 , the President of the Security Council , on behalf of the members of the Council , indicated that in light of the discussion at the informal consultations of members of the Security Council , it had been concluded that the necessary agreement did not exist in the Council for a decision to change the financing of UNFICYP .
The members of the Council did agree to keep the issue under review .
Subsequently , in a further report 1 / on 30 March 1993 , the Secretary-General indicated that the size of UNFICYP had been significantly reduced owing to the withdrawal of 323 personnel from the Danish battalion , 198 personnel from the United Kingdom contingent , 63 personnel from the Austrian contingent and 61 personnel from the Canadian contingent .
This resulted in a reduction in the combined military personnel and civilian police strength from 2,141 in May 1992 to 1,513 in March 1993 .
It was also indicated that the remaining 445 Canadian personnel would withdraw in June 1993 .
On 27 May 1993 , the Security Council adopted its resolution 831 ( 1993 ) in which , inter alia , it decided that the costs of UNFICYP which were not covered by voluntary contributions should be treated as expenses of the Organization , effective from the extension of the mandate on 15 June 1993 .
V. FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION
From the inception of the Force , the Secretary-General established an account outside the regular budget , covering all financial transactions pertaining to UNFICYP .
The UNFICYP account is kept on a calendar-year basis ; the financial statements are produced and audited on a biennial basis in accordance with United Nations financial regulations 11.1 and 11.4 .
The Regulations for UNFICYP issued on 25 April 1964 ( ST / SGB / UNFICYP / 1 ) indicated , under paragraph 19 , that &quot; Financial administration of the Force shall be limited to the voluntary contributions in cash or in-kind made available to the United Nations and shall be in accordance with the Financial Rules and Regulations of the United Nations and the procedures prescribed by the Secretary-General &quot; .
Consequently , the Secretary-General has no authority to provide United Nations funds to meet costs pertaining to UNFICYP other than through voluntary contributions received for the purpose .
The Security Council , prior to its decision to extend the mandate of UNFICYP , is informed by the Secretary-General of the cost estimate for maintaining the Force during the extension period , including the operational expenses to be borne by the Organization as well as the amounts required to reimburse the troop-contributing Governments for the extra and extraordinary expenses which they would seek to be reimbursed by the United Nations .
Allotments are issued within the limits of the overall funds available to UNFICYP .
In the issuance of such allotments , the current operational requirements , and those of the immediate future if an extension of the mandate is approaching , take precedence over reimbursement commitments to troop-contributing Governments .
Allotments for any one mandate period , therefore , may be greater than the contributions received for the same period , provided the total amount of funds available to UNFICYP for that and all other mandate periods is not exceeded .
Reimbursement commitments are reflected in the account only to the extent of available funds with the outstanding balance indicated by a footnote to the account .
As regards the period beginning 16 June 1993 , the Secretary-General recommends the establishment of a special account for UNFICYP , under the authority of regulation 6.6 of the Financial Regulations of the United Nations , for the purpose of accounting for income received and expenditure incurred in respect of the Mission .
VI . VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS
As indicated in section IV above , prior to 16 June 1993 the financing of the administrative and logistic costs of the Force , as well as certain extra and extraordinary costs incurred by troop-contributing Governments , which were borne by the Organization , were dependent entirely on voluntary contributions from Governments .
Under those arrangements , the troop-contributing Governments made available to the United Nations troops whose regular pay and allowances and normal matériel expenses they agreed to pay themselves .
In addition , in accordance with article 19 of the Status of the Force Agreement , 2 / the Government of Cyprus provides , without cost to the Force and in agreement with the Force Commander , areas for headquarters , camps , and other premises as may be necessary for the accommodation and the fulfilment of the functions of UNFICYP .
As stated earlier , the voluntary contributions received have never been adequate to meet the costs to the United Nations of UNFICYP .
For the period since the inception of the Force until 15 June 1993 , 79 countries , including a number of the troop-contributing Member States ( see annex VII ) , have provided voluntary financial support to UNFICYP totalling some $ 490.2 million in cash contributions ( $ 474.5 million ) and pledges ( $ 15.7 million ) .
However , owing to consistent shortfalls during the period to meet the costs for which the Organization is responsible , the UNFICYP account is in arrears by over $ 200 million .
As regards the period beginning 16 June 1993 , two pledges of contributions have been received for UNFICYP .
A second pledge was received from the Government of Greece , by letter dated 7 May 1993 , which informed the Secretary-General of the decision of the Government of Greece to increase its annual voluntary contribution to UNFICYP to $ 6.5 million , should the financing system of UNFICYP be converted to assessed contributions .
Therefore , a total of $ 25 million is expected from voluntary contributions towards the estimated annual cost of UNFICYP for the period beginning 16 June 1993 .
VII . STATUS OF REIMBURSEMENT TO TROOP-CONTRIBUTING STATES
Under existing agreements made prior to 15 June 1993 , UNFICYP troop-contributors volunteered to absorb the regular costs that would be incurred by them if their contingents were serving at home ( i.e. , regular allowances and normal expenses for matériel ) .
However , as mentioned in paragraph 30 above , the cost to the United Nations for maintaining UNFICYP included amounts to reimburse the troop-contributing Governments for certain of the expenses they incurred for providing troops to the Force .
These claims were referred to as extra and extraordinary costs , for which they sought reimbursement by the United Nations .
Owing to the lack of sufficient voluntary contributions to UNFICYP , the latest reimbursement to the troop-contributing Governments for extra and extraordinary costs was made in June 1992 and covered claims for the six-month period ending December 1981 .
The composition of the claims for extra and extraordinary costs differed among the troop-contributing Governments and included a variety of costs for such items as overseas / special / expatriation / hardship allowances , transportation within the home country to and from embarkation points , medical examinations , inoculations , travel documents , personal clothing and equipment , special issues of battalion equipment furnished at the request of the United Nations and other stores and expendable supplies not provided by the United Nations .
Beginning 16 June 1993 , the cost estimates provide for standard troop-costs reimbursement , based on the rates established by the General Assembly in its resolution 45 / 258 of 3 May 1991 .
No reimbursement to the troop-contributors has been made for this period .
UNITED NATIONS PEACE-KEEPING FORCE IN CYPRUS
In order to provide UNFICYP with the necessary funding for its maintenance for the period beginning 16 June 1993 , the Secretary-General , in a letter dated 23 June 1993 , sought the concurrence of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions to enter into commitments in an amount not to exceed $ 6.9 million for the period from 16 June to 30 September 1993 , pending the submission of a detailed report on the financing of UNFICYP to the General Assembly .
The Advisory Committee , in responding to the request , noted that voluntary contributions pledged and which were expected to be paid shortly , exceeded the commitment authority sought .
The Committee also noted , inter alia , that as the General Assembly had not considered the issue , the Committee should not act on this matter .
To enable UNFICYP to meet its operational requirements , and pending the submission of the present report to the General Assembly , spending authority in an amount not to exceed $ 2 million was authorized by the Controller under the provisions of United Nations financial rule 110.6 .
On 4 August 1993 , payment of the pledged contribution by the Government of Cyprus in an amount of $ 18 million was received .
A payment of $ 500,000 had been received previously for the current mandate period .
IX . OBSERVATIONS
As stated in the Secretary-General &apos;s report of 9 June 1993 , 11 / prior to 15 June 1993 UNFICYP was funded entirely from voluntary contributions from Governments .
Presently , there is an accumulated deficit of over $ 200 million due to the troop-contributing countries .
This amount represents outstanding reimbursements of UNFICYP to the troop-contributing countries under the financing scheme heretofore in place .
Consequently , the General Assembly may wish to consider necessary arrangements for financing the outstanding amount to UNFICYP troop contributors and to make the required provisions therefor .

On the basis of a request of the Secretary-General ( see A / 47 / 955 ) , the General Assembly at its 104th plenary meeting on 28 May 1993 decided to include in the agenda of its forty-seventh session an item entitled &quot; Financing of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 &quot; and to allocate it to the Fifth Committee .
4 . In its report of 22 July 1993 ( A / 47 / 980 ) , the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions brought to the attention of the General Assembly the fact that it had considered a request from the Secretary-General on the financing of the International Tribunal .
93-45986 ( E ) 230893 / ... English

be borne by the regular budget of the United Nations in accordance with Article 17 of the Charter of the United Nations &quot; .
The Committee also noted that the General Assembly had not yet taken a decision on the nature of financing of the International Tribunal , and had therefore requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on the requirements of the Tribunal to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session , based on such decisions as the Assembly might take at its resumed forty-seventh session on the nature of the financing of the Tribunal .
5 . In the light of the above , the General Assembly may wish to take a decision on the nature of the financing of the International Tribunal during its forty-seventh session .
6 . Article 32 of the Statute of the International Tribunal , entitled &quot; Expenses of the International Tribunal &quot; ( quoted in para . 4 above ) , was included in the report of the Secretary-General prepared pursuant to paragraph 2 of Security Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) ( S / 25704 and Corr.1 ) .
By that resolution , the Secretary-General had been requested to submit a report on all aspects of this matter , including specific proposals and where appropriate , options for the effective and expeditious implementation of the decision to establish an international tribunal , taking into account suggestions put forward in this regard by Member States .
7 . The Secretary-General had decided to include in his report a reference to the financial arrangements for the International Tribunal , in the light of the Council &apos;s request that he submit a report &quot; on all aspects &quot; of the matter , including specific proposals &quot; for the effective and expeditious implementation &quot; of the decision to establish an international tribunal .
It had been quite explicitly indicated in the relevant Council consultations that the report was expected to cover the question of financial arrangements , and to omit from the report references to that important aspect of the matter would not have been in compliance with the Council &apos;s request .
Moreover , leaving the matter open would not have facilitated the effective and expeditious implementation of the decision to establish an international tribunal .
The Secretary-General had thus concluded that as the proposed Statute of the International Tribunal would be comprehensive and intended for effective and expeditious implementation , it would contain a specific provision on the expenses of the International Tribunal .
That conclusion was reached without prejudice to the role of the General Assembly in the administrative and budgetary aspects of the question of establishing the International Tribunal , to which reference was made in the report ( S / 25704 , para . 21 ) .
8 . As to the content of such a provision , the Secretary-General had considered various possible ways by which the International Tribunal could be financed : through voluntary contributions ; as expenses of the Organization borne according to an ad hoc scale of assessments similar to scales of assessments drawn up for peace-keeping operations ; as expenses of the Organization borne through the regular budget of the United Nations ; or through any combination of the foregoing .
9 . As experience shows , funding the International Tribunal through voluntary contributions , wholly or in part , would not , in the view of the Secretary-General , lead to an effective and expeditious implementation of the decision to establish an international tribunal .
10 . While the International Tribunal was established by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII as a measure to maintain and restore international peace and security , the Tribunal was not thereby to be equated to a peace-keeping operation .
The International Tribunal is a subsidiary organ of the Security Council of a judicial nature , having as its mandate the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991 .
Its mandate is not analogous to mandates given by the Security Council to peace-keeping operations which have particular political objectives and which often include military , police or security components .
11 . In the light of the above , the Secretary-General decided to propose an article for inclusion in the Statute providing that the expenses of the International Tribunal shall be borne by the regular budget of the Organization .
12 . The Security Council approved the approach of the Secretary-General outlined above and included the proposed article in the Statute adopted .
In the view of the Secretary-General , within the context of preparing a comprehensive Statute of the International Tribunal to be implemented effectively and expeditiously , there was no legal bar to the Security Council reaching its own conclusions as to the appropriate financing of the International Tribunal and including a provision on the matter in the Statute which it adopted .
Nevertheless , such conclusions are without prejudice to the authority of the General Assembly under the Charter to consider and approve the budget of the Organization and to apportion the expenses of the Organization among its Members .

Forty-seventh session
Agenda item 157
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative
and Budgetary Questions
1 . The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General ( A / 47 / 1001 ) on the financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus ( UNFICYP ) .
The Committee met with representatives of the Secretary-General who provided additional information .
2 . The Committee &apos;s consideration of the Secretary-General &apos;s report was on the basis of an advance text in English ; members of the Committee have agreed to such a procedure with increasing frequency , especially with regard to peace-keeping operations , in an effort to respond to urgent situations and also to conform to the schedule of the Fifth Committee .
Aside from the burden this places on members who legitimately would prefer to work in one of the other official languages of the United Nations , the Committee points out that the Secretary-General &apos;s reports are frequently corrected or otherwise changed before circulation in final form ; this makes it more difficult for the Committee to ensure the accuracy of its own reports .
The Committee trusts that the Secretary-General will redouble his efforts to ensure timely submission of final documentation , in all languages , to the Committee .
3 . By its resolution 186 ( 1964 ) of 4 March 1964 , the Security Council recommended that the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus be established and be stationed in Cyprus for a period of three months , with a mandate to use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of fighting and , as necessary , to contribute to the maintenance and restoration of law and order and a return to normal conditions .
The costs of UNFICYP were to be met by the Governments providing the contingents and by the Government of Cyprus ; the Secretary-General has also accepted voluntary contributions for UNFICYP .
In paragraph 41 of his report , the Secretary-General refers to amounts which have not been reimbursed to certain troop contributors in respect of past mandate periods .
4 . UNFICYP became operational on 27 March 1964 .
Since then the Security Council has extended the duration of the mandate of UNFICYP mainly for six-month periods , most recently by resolution 839 ( 1993 ) of 11 June 1993 , by which the mandate was extended from 16 June to 15 December 1993 .
5 . For the period beginning on 16 June 1993 , the Secretary-General has proposed that the costs of UNFICYP which are not covered by voluntary contributions should be assessed on Member States from that date and that a new special account should be established .
6 . As indicated in paragraph 33 of the report , the Government of Cyprus , by a letter dated 15 April 1993 to the Secretary-General , conveyed its offer to contribute , on a continuing basis , that is , for the period beginning on 16 June 1993 and future periods , a voluntary contribution equal to one third of the annual cost of UNFICYP .
In a subsequent letter dated 10 May 1993 , the Government of Cyprus confirmed that its voluntary contribution for the 12-month period beginning on 16 June 1993 would be increased to $ 18.5 million .
7 . By a letter dated 7 May 1993 , the Government of Greece informed the Secretary-General of its decision to increase its annual voluntary contribution to UNFICYP to $ 6.5 million , provided that there is a decision to base the financing of UNFICYP on assessed contributions and that the structure and the strength of the Force , that is , at least six companies , remain unchanged .
8 . The Secretary-General estimates that the cost of maintaining UNFICYP for the current mandate period of six months from 16 June to 15 December 1993 is $ 21,512,000 gross ( $ 21,153,300 net ) .
Taking into account voluntary contributions of $ 12,500,000 , the Secretary-General is proposing an appropriation of the amount of $ 9,012,000 gross ( $ 8,653,300 net ) and the apportionment thereof , for the period from 16 June to 15 December 1993 .
9 . The Committee points out that it is for the General Assembly to decide on how the expenditures of UNFICYP are to be financed .
It therefore submits its comments and recommendations in the paragraphs below without prejudice to any decision the General Assembly may take on the question of financing .
The Committee requests the Secretary-General , following that reassessment , to report to the General Assembly on the administrative and financial aspects of such decisions as the Security Council may take .
11 . The Security Council , in its resolution 831 ( 1993 ) , decided that UNFICYP should be restructured , as a first step , on the basis of the proposal set out in paragraphs 16 to 19 of the Secretary-General &apos;s report of 30 March 1993 ( S / 25492 ) , that is , at a strength of three infantry battalions of approximately 350 personnel each , with the addition of a limited number of military observers .
12 . The operational plan for UNFICYP called for by the Security Council in its resolution 831 ( 1993 ) is outlined in paragraphs 5 to 11 of the report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly ( A / 47 / 1001 ) .
As stated in paragraph 9 of the report , the current authorized troop strength of the Force is 1,323 , consisting of infantry personnel ( 1,050 ) , support personnel , including 37 military personnel forming the headquarters unit ( 223 ) , civilian police ( 38 ) and military observers ( 12 ) . English
Page 13 . For operational purposes , UNFICYP will be divided into three sectors covered by three battalions .
The Committee was informed that at the present time only two battalions were physically available to UNFICYP and that a third battalion was tentatively scheduled to arrive in early September 1993 .
The Committee points out that , should that schedule not be met , there will be savings for the period for each day of delay after 1 September 1993 .
14 . The Committee understands that certain of the standard rates used in the calculations in the budget estimates have been adjusted as the result of the Secretary-General &apos;s proposal on the financing of UNFICYP .
The Committee requests the Secretary-General to review those rates and to justify fully any change from the standard rates used prior to 16 June 1993 , in the report requested in paragraph 10 above .
15 . In the opinion of the Committee , the role and functions of the military observers being introduced in UNFICYP are still to be defined .
The Committee expects that that will be done on the basis of experience gained during the current mandate and explained in the context of the forthcoming report of the Secretary-General ( see para . 10 above ) .
16 . The Committee notes from annex II , table I , of the report that , at this stage , the Secretary-General is proposing an increase of 21 posts in the current civilian staffing component of UNFICYP of 452 posts .
Of the 21 additional proposed posts , 8 are in the Field Service category and 13 are local staff .
In this connection , the Committee was informed that the existing 414 and the proposed additional 13 local personnel are , and would continue to be , obtained through contractual services from the United Kingdom Command Secretariat , and as such they are not United Nations personnel .
Pending such a review the Committee does not recommend approval of the additional 13 posts .
For similar reasons the Committee does not recommend approval of the eight additional posts in the Field Service category at this stage .
The total resultant savings for six months would be $ 241,500 gross ( $ 210,200 net ) .
18 . Having considered the job descriptions relating to international staff set out in annex VIII to the report and the additional information provided by the representatives of the Secretary-General , the Committee is not convinced that the functions of the existing spokesman ( P-5 ) post cannot be combined with those of the existing Senior Adviser ( D-1 ) post .
In this connection the Committee also believes that some of the non-technical functions of the Field Service posts listed in annex VIII could either be combined or performed by locally recruited personnel .
19 . The Committee notes that provision is made for 50 consultancy days at $ 568 per day , together with subsistence allowance at $ 204 per day for 50 days for the non-resident Special Representative of the Secretary-General .
In addition , there is a Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General who is at the Assistant Secretary-General level and resident in Cyprus .
The Committee believes that this arrangement requires additional clarification and justification , especially as concerns the consultant status of the Special Representative ( see para . 10 above ) .
20 . The Committee notes that in recent months the Secretary-General has appointed a number of representatives and envoys and in this connection reiterates its view ( see A / 47 / 990 ) that there is a need for a clear statement of the rationale for the establishment of posts at the Assistant Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General levels .
Furthermore the Committee believes that not only should there be a policy for the establishment of such high-level posts but that criteria for determining the related emoluments should also be established .
21 . The Committee was informed that when the Secretary-General &apos;s cost estimates for UNFICYP were being prepared it was not known how much equipment , with the exception of some communications equipment , could be obtained from the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia ( UNTAC ) .
In this connection , the Committee requests the Secretary-General to review the situation vis-à-vis the disposition of UNTAC assets and to report to it in the context of the report requested in paragraph 10 above .
22 . With regard to transport operation costs , as reflected in paragraph 31 of annex II , provision has been made in the estimates for the acquisition of 16 vehicles at a cost of $ 126,600 .
The Committee was informed that those vehicles were obtained at favourable rates from the departing Canadian contingent .
The proposed distribution of vehicles is set out in annex V. From the information provided to it , the Committee believes that the number of vehicles proposed should be revised .
23 . The Committee was informed that humanitarian activities in the area were not on the scale or of the nature of the humanitarian activities associated with other recent peace-keeping operations .
In UNFICYP those activities have traditionally included facilitating family reunion visits between the two communities in Cyprus , the delivery of medicines and pension cheques to enclosed communities , supervision of medical evacuations , and facilitating communications between authorities of public utilities .
The Committee was informed that while those activities require relatively few UNFICYP personnel , they have a vital impact in improvement of intercommunal relations .
24 . In view of the general observations and recommendations set out above , particularly in paragraph 17 , the Committee believes that the cost for the maintenance of UNFICYP for the period from 16 June to 15 December 1993 should not exceed $ 21,271,000 gross ( $ 20,943,000 net ) .
Should the General Assembly decide that the costs of UNFICYP which are not covered by voluntary contributions should be assessed on Member States , the resulting appropriation should not exceed $ 8,771,000 gross ( $ 8,443,000 net ) .

I. INTRODUCTION
1 . By its resolution 827 ( 1993 ) of 25 May 1993 , the Security Council approved the report of the Secretary-General prepared pursuant to paragraph 2 of Council resolution 808 ( 1993 ) of 22 February 1993 ( S / 25704 and Corr.1 and Add.1 ) , and decided to establish an international tribunal for the sole purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia between 1 January 1991 and a date to be determined by the Security Council upon the restoration of peace , and to that end to adopt the Statute of the International Tribunal annexed to the Secretary-General &apos;s report .
2 . At its 104th plenary meeting , on 28 May 1993 , the General Assembly decided , on the proposal of the Secretary-General ( A / 47 / 955 , para . 1 ) , to include in the agenda of its forty-seventh session an item entitled &quot; Election of judges of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 &quot; ( item 156 ) .
3 . Pursuant to article 13 , subparagraph 2 ( a ) , of the Statute of the International Tribunal , the Legal Counsel , on behalf of the Secretary-General , invited , by circular letter of 3 June 1993 , all States Members of the United Nations and non-member States maintaining permanent observer missions at United Nations Headquarters to submit their nominations for judges of the International Tribunal .
In accordance with article 13 , subparagraph 2 ( b ) , of the Statute , each State was invited to nominate , within 60 days of the date of the invitation , up to two candidates , no two of whom were to be of the same nationality .
4 . The nominations received were forwarded by the Secretary-General to the President of the Security Council in accordance with article 13 , subparagraph 2 ( c ) , of the Statute of the International Tribunal .
At its 3265th meeting , on 20 August 1993 , the Security Council , in accordance with that article , established a list of 23 candidates , taking due account of the adequate representation of the principal legal systems of the world .
The list was adopted in resolution 857 ( 1993 ) , and was formally conveyed to the President of the General Assembly by letter dated 20 August 1993 from the President of the Security Council ( A / 47 / 1003 ) .
5 . The list of candidates for judges and the procedure for the election of the judges of the International Tribunal are set out below .
The curricula vitae of the candidates will be transmitted to the General Assembly in a separate document ( A / 47 / 1006 ) .
II . LIST OF CANDIDATES FOR JUDGES OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL
6 . The list of candidates for judges of the International Tribunal is as follows : *
Mr. Georges Michel ABI-SAAB ( Egypt )
Mr. Julio A. BARBERIS ( Argentina )
Mr. Raphaël BARRAS ( Switzerland )
Mr. Sikhe CAMARA ( Guinea )
Mr. Antonio CASSESE ( Italy )
Mr. Alfonso DE LOS HEROS ( Peru )

Mr. Moragodage Christopher Walter PINTO ( Sri Lanka )
Mr. Rustam S. SIDHWA ( Pakistan )
Sir Ninian STEPHEN ( Australia )
Mr. Lal Chan VOHRAH ( Malaysia )
III . PROCEDURE FOR THE ELECTION OF JUDGES
7 . The election of judges will take place in accordance with the following provisions :
( a ) Article 13 of the Statute of the International Tribunal ;
( b ) Given the similar nature of the election of judges of the International Court of Justice and the election of judges of the International Tribunal , the Secretary-General suggests that similar election procedures should be followed in the General Assembly .
For this reason , it is suggested that rule 151 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly shall apply to the election of judges of the International Tribunal .
8 . In accordance with article 13 , subparagraph 2 ( a ) , of the Statute of the International Tribunal , the Holy See and Switzerland , the two non-member States maintaining permanent observer missions at United Nations Headquarters which were invited to nominate judges for the International Tribunal , will participate in the election in the same manner as the States Members of the United Nations .
9 . On the date of the election , the General Assembly shall elect 11 judges from the list of candidates submitted to it by the Security Council .
Only those candidates whose names appear on the ballot papers are eligible for election .
The electors will indicate the candidates for whom they wish to vote by placing crosses against their names on the ballot papers .
10 . The candidates who receive an absolute majority of the votes of States Members of the United Nations and of the non-member States maintaining permanent observer missions at United Nations Headquarters shall be declared elected ( art . 13 , subpara . 2 ( d ) , of the Statute ) .
11 . The consistent practice of the United Nations has been to interpret the words &quot; absolute majority &quot; as meaning a majority of all electors , whether or not they vote . The electors , for this purpose , are all the Member States and the two non-member States mentioned in paragraph 8 above .
Accordingly , 94 votes constitute an absolute majority in the General Assembly for the purpose of electing judges of the International Tribunal .
12 . If fewer than the required number of candidates obtain the absolute majority in the first ballot , a second ballot will be held and balloting will continue at the same meeting until the required number of candidates obtain an absolute majority .
Following the practice in the election of judges of the International Court of Justice , the Secretary-General suggests that subsequent balloting shall be unrestricted .
Accordingly , each elector may vote for 11 candidates in the first ballot and , in any subsequent ballots , for 11 less the number of candidates who have already obtained absolute majorities .
13 . If more than the required number of candidates obtain the absolute majority of votes in the first ballot , a second ballot will be held on all candidates and balloting will continue at the same meeting until the required number of candidates , and no more , obtain an absolute majority .
In any such case , each elector may vote , in the first ballot and in any subsequent ballot , for 11 candidates .
14 . When 11 candidates obtain the required majority , the President of the General Assembly shall declare the candidates elected .

For years , the Greek Cypriot administration has been claiming that the Turkish Cypriot side is trying to change the demographic structure of Cyprus and , by using false figures which defy even the elementary norms of logic , has been attempting to deceive world public opinion .
A new example of this is the allegation that 5,000 Turkish nationals have recently been given Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus citizenship .
To claim that it is even possible to grant citizenship to so many people within the short time that has elapsed since the amendment of the old and outdated citizenship law , the Greek Cypriot authorities must be living in a dream world and must be running out of propaganda material .

ANNEX
Declaration of 27 August 1993 on the Situation in Nicaragua
Considering that peace in Central America is one , undivided and indivisible , and that , therefore , any development which disrupts peace has repercussions throughout the region and , in observance of the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States , calls for prompt action by the Presidents with a view to helping to maintain political stability , the constitutional State and democratic institutions in Central America ,
Accordingly , in order to promote the strengthening of the conditions that will enable the democratic process in Nicaragua to be consolidated , we , the Presidents of Costa Rica , El Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras and Panama , meeting with the President of Nicaragua in the City of San Salvador , El Salvador , have decided :
( 1 ) To state our strongest condemnation of any act of violence and terrorism which threatens the life and personal safety of Nicaraguans or the security of the State and the stability of the lawfully constituted Government ;
( 2 ) To express our solidarity with and resolute support for the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua and its President , Mrs. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro , in their endeavour to find workable solutions to the problems of the country , reaffirming our belief that the fullest respect for laws and democratic institutions is essential ;
( 3 ) To appeal to the various sectors of national life in Nicaragua to assume their share of responsibility in building the future of that fraternal country , urging them to reach a national agreement that will help to consolidate the political , economic and social stability which the fraternal nation seeks .
We therefore support the early implementation of the Agreement which was concluded on 21 August 1993 between the Government of Nicaragua , the Unión Nacional Opositora and the Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional for the purpose of removing all the obstacles that thus far have impeded institutional , economic and social normalization and the search for the general welfare of Nicaragua ;
( 4 ) At the request of the President of Nicaragua , and pursuant to articles 3 , 15 and 17 of the Tegucigalpa Protocol , which are aimed at achieving the objective of the Central American Integration System of transforming Central America into a &quot; region of peace , freedom , democracy and development &quot; , to instruct the Ministers for Foreign Affairs to use their good offices to bring about national agreement in Nicaragua ;
( 5 ) To appeal to the international community to continue to provide Nicaragua with the necessary cooperation to strengthen peace and reconciliation in the Nicaraguan family , this being a prerequisite for promoting the climate of political and social stability that will enable the nation to develop fully , ensuring the well-being of its people .

ANNEX
Statement on Haiti issued by the European Community and its
member States on 1 September 1993
The European Community and its member States welcome the ratification of Mr. Malval as Prime Minister by the Haitian parliament and his investiture by President Aristede .
This investiture constitutes a fundamental stage in the implementation of the New York agreement of 3 July 1993 .
Following the suspension of sanctions on 27 August 1993 by the Security Council , the European Community and its member States are suspending the measures which they had introduced pursuant to Council resolution 841 ( 1993 ) of 16 June .
In accordance with their statement of 6 July , they will be resuming their cooperation with Haiti , which was interrupted by the coup d &apos;état .
The European Community and its member States sincerely hope that the taking up of his duties by the Prime Minister will be followed by the implementation of the other points in the agreement of 3 July 1993 in order to conclude swiftly the process of restoring constitutional order and make possible the return of President Aristide to Haiti .

ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND ORGANIZATION OF WORK
REPORT OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT : QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE WORLD SOCIAL
Letter dated 2 September 1993 from the President of the
Economic and Social Council to the President of the General Assembly
The Economic and Social Council , in its resolution 1993 / 23 of 27 July 1993 , which was adopted on the recommendation of the Commission for Social Development , approved the attached draft resolution entitled &quot; International Year of the Family &quot; , for transmission to the General Assembly for its adoption .
The draft resolution contains several provisions which call for immediate action , including some during the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly , in prior consultation with Member States .
One such recommendation is contained in paragraph 14 , in which the Assembly would decide &quot; to devote one of its plenary meetings at its forty-eighth session , in early December 1993 , to launching the International Year of the Family &quot; ; another is contained in paragraph 20 , requesting the Secretary-General &quot; to seek the views of Member States of the Commission for Social Development on the desirability to work out a declaration on the role , responsibilities and rights of families on the occasion of the International Year of the Family &quot; .
Should the draft resolution , according to normal procedures , be submitted to the General Assembly for action at its forty-eighth session , it would not be acted upon until the Assembly considers the report of the Economic and Social Council during the latter part of its forty-eighth session .
This would leave very little time to take adequate preparatory steps for the Assembly &apos;s launching of the International Year of the Family in early December 1993 .
Therefore , it is of special urgency that the Assembly give earlier consideration to the draft resolution than under its routine procedures .
Further to consultations with the Coordinator for the International Year of the Family , I wish to propose that , because of the exigencies of the situation , the draft resolution be acted upon by the General Assembly at one of its last meetings of the forty-seventh session , thereby greatly facilitating the preparatory process to the International Year of the Family .
I have been informed that , in August , the matter of an earlier action on the resolution had been presented to the chairman of the regional groups by the Coordinator for the Year during his visit to New York and that they had consented to brief their respective groups in detail on the matter .
I should be grateful to Your Excellency for your prompt consideration of tha matter and for your concurrence that we take up this resolution at the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly .

7 . Notes with interest the proposal by the Government of Slovakia that the Bratislava International Centre for Family Studies be affiliated with the United Nations ;

16 . Requests the Commission on Human Rights , the Population Commission and the Commission on the Status of Women to include in the agendas for their sessions in 1993 or 1994 consideration of the principles and objectives of the Year in the context of their major areas of concern , and to propose specific follow-up measures regarding human rights , population issues and the advancement of women as each affects or is affected by families , including family-oriented components of the World Conference on Human Rights , to be held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 , the International Conference on Population and Development , to be held at Cairo from 5 to 13 September 1994 , the World Summit for Social Development , to be held in Denmark in 1995 , and the Fourth World Conference on Women : Action for Equality , Development and Peace , to be held at Beijing from 4 to 15 September 1995 ;

Recognizing that , in order to meet the expenditures caused by the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus with effect from 16 June 1993 , a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations ,
Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation ,
Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council , as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 ( S-IV ) of 27 June 1963 , in the financing of such operations ,
Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force by certain Governments ,
Noting that voluntary contributions were insufficient to cover all of the costs of the operation , including those incurred by troop-contributing Governments prior to 15 June 1993 , and regretting the absence of an adequate response to the various appeals for voluntary contributions , including that contained in section IV of General Assembly resolution 47 / 218 of 23 December 1992,

8 . Decides also to appropriate the amount of 8,771,000 United States dollars gross ( 8,443,000 dollars net ) for the period from 16 June to 15 December 1993 , and , accordingly , requests the Secretary-General to establish a special account for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus in accordance with paragraph 29 of his report ; 1 /
9 . Decides further , as an ad hoc arrangement , to apportion the amount of 8,771,000 dollars gross ( 8,443,000 dollars net ) for the above-mentioned period among Member States , in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43 / 232 of 1 March 1989 , as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44 / 192 B of 21 December 1989 , 45 / 269 of 27 August 1991 , 46 / 198 of 20 December 1991 and 47 / 218 of 23 December 1992 , and taking into account the scale of assessments set out in resolution 46 / 221 A of 20 December 1991 and decision 47 / 456 of 23 December 1992 ;
English Page 10 . Decides that , in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 ( X ) of 15 December 1955 , there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated staff assessment income of 328,000 dollars for the period from 16 June to 15 December 1993 approved for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus ;

14 . Decides to maintain as separate the account established prior to 16 June 1993 for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus , invites Member States to make voluntary contributions to that account , and , in this regard , requests the Secretary-General to intensify his efforts in appealing for voluntary contributions to this account ;
15 . Requests the Secretary-General , taking into account the voluntary nature of the financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus prior to 16 June 1993 , to report , no later than 31 January 1994 , on the standing of the account referred to in paragraph 14 of the present resolution ;
16 . Decides to include in the agenda of its forty-eighth session the item entitled &quot; Financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus &quot; .

Statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Malaysia on
the mutual recognition between the Palestine Liberation
Organization and Israel and on the Agreement on Palestinian
Malaysia welcomes the decision reached between the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) and Israel on mutual recognition as well as the historic agreement for a Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza-Jericho occupied territories signed in Washington on 13 September 1993 .
We view these latest events as a positive and forward movement in the long and arduous search for a comprehensive , just and durable solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict .
Malaysia has consistently urged for an early resolution of the Palestinian problem based on justice and through negotiations .
In this context , we have lent our support to the Middle East peace process and have called all parties concerned to demonstrate the necessary political will and good faith in resolving the conflict .
Malaysia would also like to take this opportunity to commend the Palestinian leadership for its realistic and courageous act in leading the Palestinian people towards a new and promising future .
We are confident that the PLO and Israel , as well as other Arab States in the Middle East , will build on this initial success and continue to strive to bring about a new era of long-lasting peace , stability and prosperity to the region .

ANNEX
Statement issued on 10 September 1993 by the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Worship of Bolivia
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship expresses its satisfaction at the agreement on mutual recognition reached by the State of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization .
This agreement marks the beginning of an era of peace in the Middle East , which has been long awaited by the international community .
The compromise between Israelis and Palestinians reflects a new spirit of justice and cooperative dialogue among nations which , for historical reasons , have been in a state of confrontation .
The mutual acceptance of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war , and the need to work for a just and lasting peace and to terminate all military activity , proposed in Security Council resolutions 242 ( 1967 ) and 338 ( 1973 ) is , undoubtedly , a highly significant step towards a new order in international relations .
This event is a historic lesson in the search for solutions in regions where the painful legacy of history continues to hinder development , justice , coexistence and true friendship among peoples and Governments .
In keeping with its pacifist policy , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship declares that it will continue to support efforts to strengthen peace in the Middle East , in accordance with the norms of international law and justice , which should prevail in international relations .
Through this Ministry , and on the occasion of this historic event , the Government of Bolivia , shares the satisfaction of Bolivian citizens of Israeli and Palestinian descent .

I. INTRODUCTION
The United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission ( UNIKOM ) was set up by the Security Council , in accordance with its resolution 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 .
By its resolution 689 ( 1991 ) of 9 April 1991 , the Council decided to review the question of the termination or continuation of UNIKOM every six months .
The General Assembly , in its resolution 47 / 208 of 22 December 1992 , appropriated an amount of $ 20 million gross ( $ 19,192,400 net ) for the maintenance of UNIKOM from 1 November 1992 to 30 April 1993 .
By the same resolution , the Assembly authorized the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for the Observation Mission at a rate not to exceed $ 3.3 million gross ( $ 3.1 million net ) per month , subject to the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions , for the period from 1 May to 31 October 1993 , inclusive , should the Security Council decide to continue the Observation Mission beyond 8 April 1993 .
The appropriation and commitment authority approved by the General Assembly in resolution 47 / 208 for the period from 1 November 1992 to 31 October 1993 provided for the cost of 248 military observers , 115 logistic support personnel , 90 international civilian staff and 96 locally recruited staff .
II . STRENGTHENING OF THE UNITED NATIONS IRAQ-KUWAIT OBSERVATION MISSION
Secondly , up to 500 Iraqi personnel dismantled prefabricated buildings in the former naval base and removed the parts and other items .
Thirdly , the Chairman of Iraq &apos;s Higher Committee for Coordination raised with UNIKOM &apos;s Chief Military Observer the question of the retrieval by Iraq of the prefabricated buildings which Iraq had made available to UNIKOM in a part of the former naval base ( Camp Khor ) .
Following consultations , the President of the Security Council , in his statement of 11 January 1993 , 2 / invited the Secretary-General , as a first step , to explore on an urgent basis the possibilities for restoring UNIKOM to its full strength .
He also asked the Secretary-General to consider in an emergency such as the present one the need for rapid reinforcement as set out in paragraph 18 of the Secretary-General &apos;s report of 12 June 1991 , 3 / as well as any other suggestions to enhance the effectiveness of UNIKOM , and to report back to the Council .
In a report to the Security Council dated 18 January 1993 , 4 / the Secretary-General stated that , should the Security Council decide that UNIKOM &apos;s present mandate does not permit an adequate response to such violations as had occurred and that UNIKOM should be able to prevent and redress them , then UNIKOM would require a capacity to take physical action .
Such action could be taken to prevent or , if that fails , redress :
( a ) Small-scale violations of the demilitarized zone ( DMZ ) ;
( b ) Violations of the boundary between Iraq and Kuwait , for example , by civilians or police ;
( c ) Problems that might arise from the presence of Iraqi installations and Iraqi citizens and their assets in the DMZ on the Kuwaiti side of the newly demarcated boundary .
It was estimated that three mechanized infantry battalions would be required to perform the above functions .
In addition , UNIKOM &apos;s airlift capability would need to be augmented so that it could lift one company in one wave for rapid reaction .
The total additional military support needed to enable UNIKOM to carry out its new mandate with regard to the land boundary would comprise the following elements : ( a ) 225 Headquarters and communications personnel ; ( b ) 2,250 infantry personnel ; ( c ) 750 logistic personnel ; ( d ) 200 engineers ; and ( e ) 100 medical personnel and 120 air personnel .
A total of 20 helicopters would also be needed .
If the Security Council required the force also to prevent violations of the maritime boundary , when demarcated , UNIKOM would need naval assets , with the necessary docking facilities , to enable it to patrol the Khawr Abd Allah and intercept any violating vessels .
Following the introduction of the infantry units , the present tasks of the military observers would be assigned to the infantry , which would be deployed at the existing patrol and observation bases and which would patrol the DMZ .
The units would need to include a sufficient number of officers to carry out liaison , investigations and other special tasks .
By its resolution 806 ( 1993 ) of 5 February 1993 , the Security Council decided to extend the terms of reference of UNIKOM to include the functions contained in paragraph 5 of the Secretary-General &apos;s report 4 / ( and listed in para . 6 above ) .
The Council also requested the Secretary-General to plan and execute a phased deployment of the strengthening of UNIKOM taking into account the need for economy and other relevant factors .
In his report to the Security Council dated 2 April 1993 , 5 / the Secretary-General stated that he planned to retain the military observers and to reinforce them by one mechanized infantry battalion to be deployed in the northern sector of the DMZ .
He also stated that the Mission &apos;s logistic support elements would be reinforced slightly by the addition of five logistic personnel and 15 medical personnel .
In the same report , the Secretary-General recommended that UNIKOM be maintained for a further six-month period from 9 April to 8 October 1993 .
On 13 April 1993 , the President of the Security Council informed the Secretary-General by letter 6 / that the Council concurred with his recommendations .
III . STATUS OF ASSESSED CONTRIBUTIONS
As at 24 May 1993 , assessments totalling $ 159,592,821 had been apportioned among Member States in respect of UNIKOM for the period from its inception on 9 April 1991 to 31 October 1993 .
Contributions received for the same period amounted to $ 126,524,723 , representing a shortfall of $ 33,068,098 .
The details are contained in table 1 below .

IV . VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS
The General Assembly , in paragraph 13 of its resolution 47 / 208 , invited Member States to make voluntary contributions to UNIKOM both in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General .
For the period from 1 November 1992 to 30 April 1993 , voluntary contributions received by UNIKOM for which no budgetary provision was made consisted of : ( a ) the rental of four road graders , two dozers , two excavators and four tractors by the Government of Kuwait , the value of which has not yet been communicated to the Secretariat ; and ( b ) the service of two fixed-wing aircraft with crew provided by the Government of Switzerland .
This contribution has been valued at SwF 1.2 million , approximately equivalent to $ 794,702 .
V. FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION
A. Application of article IV of the Financial
Regulations of the United Nations
Paragraph 15 of document A / 47 / 637 of 12 November 1992 , on the financing of UNIKOM , states :
&quot; It is proposed that the standing decision , as contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 45 / 265 and restated in paragraph 13 above , be extended and applied to UNIKOM . &quot;
In paragraph 10 of its report dated 30 November 1992 ( A / 47 / 735 ) , the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions stated that it would defer consideration of this question until the spring of 1993 , without prejudice to existing arrangements .
This proposal remains in effect .
B. Resources made available and operating costs for the
The total resources made available to UNIKOM for the period from 9 April 1991 to 31 October 1993 amount to $ 162,877,000 gross ( $ 158,139,600 net ) , consisting of appropriations totalling $ 143,077,000 and a commitment authorization of $ 19,800,000 .
Estimated expenditures for this period amounted to $ 151,572,633 gross ( $ 147,827,860 net ) , resulting in an unencumbered balance of $ 11,304,367 gross ( $ 10,311,740 net ) .
In addition , interest and miscellaneous income during the period totalled $ 631,929 and $ 1,685,902 , respectively .
As a result of the shortfall in payment of assessed contributions referred to in paragraph 13 above , an amount of $ 5 million has been borrowed from the Peace-keeping Reserve Fund to meet cash-flow requirements .
1 NOVEMBER 1992 TO 30 APRIL 1993
Annex I to the present report sets out by budget-line item the revised apportionment of UNIKOM for the period from 1 November 1992 to 30 April 1993 , as well as the estimated expenditures for the period .
As indicated , total expenditures amounted to $ 20 million gross ( $ 19,277,000 net ) .
Supplementary information thereon is contained in annex II .
VII . COST ESTIMATE FOR THE PERIOD FROM
1 MAY TO 31 OCTOBER 1993
Pending finalization of the present report and action by the General Assembly on the additional financing requirements of UNIKOM , the concurrence of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions was requested on 8 April 1993 to enter into commitments for the maintenance of UNIKOM for the period from 1 May to 31 October 1993 in a total amount of $ 29,800,000 gross ( $ 28,600,000 net ) consisting of the following :
( a ) The amount of $ 19,800,000 gross ( $ 18,600,000 net ) for the period from 1 May to 31 October 1993 , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 47 / 208 ;
( b ) The amount of $ 10 million in accordance with the terms of paragraph 1 of General Assembly resolution 46 / 187 of 20 December 1991 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses for the biennium 1992-1993 , in connection with the strengthening of UNIKOM authorized by Security Council resolution 806 ( 1993 ) .
The concurrence of the Advisory Committee to enter into total commitments in the reduced amount of $ 23,800,000 gross ( $ 22,600,000 net ) was contained in the Chairman &apos;s letter dated 14 April 1993 to the Secretary-General .
This total amount consists of the following :

( b ) The amount of $ 4 million in accordance with the terms of paragraph 1 of General Assembly resolution 46 / 187 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .
The estimated cost of the strengthening of UNIKOM for the six-month period from 1 May to 31 October 1993 is $ 24,616,100 gross ( $ 24,505,700 net ) .
The total cost of maintaining UNIKOM for this period would therefore be $ 44,416,100 gross ( $ 43,105,700 net ) .

The cost of maintaining UNIKOM for the 12-month period from 1 November 1993 to 31 October 1994 is estimated at $ 6,250,825 gross ( $ 6,064,700 net ) per month .
The current six-month period of UNIKOM will expire in October 1993 .
Accordingly , the Secretary-General requests that the General Assembly , at its forty-seventh session , make appropriate provision for UNIKOM &apos;s expenses for the period beyond 31 October 1993 , should the Security Council decide to continue the Mission .
Based on recent experience as a result of the decisions of the Security Council , the extensions and enlargements of mandates are sometimes decided upon without an existing financial authorization from the General Assembly .
In order to provide continuing financial authorization prior to the reconvening of the General Assembly in the event the requirements for the extensions and / or enlargements exceed the provisions of Assembly resolution 46 / 187 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses , it is prudent that continuing authorization exists for peace-keeping operations .
A summary of the cost estimate for UNIKOM for the period from 1 November 1993 to 31 October 1994 is presented in annex VI to the present report and supplementary information thereon is presented in annex VII .
During the period from 1 November 1992 to 30 April 1993 , troops were provided to UNIKOM by the Governments of Canada ( engineer unit ) , Denmark ( logistics ) and Norway ( medical personnel ) .
The Government of Canada withdrew its engineer unit at the end of March 1993 and the Secretary-General has accepted an offer from the Government of Argentina to replace it .
Full reimbursement in accordance with the standard rates of reimbursement has been made for the period ending 30 April 1993 .
X. OBSERVATIONS
During the period from 9 October 1991 to 31 December 1992 , UNIKOM provided some technical support to United Nations activities relating to the demarcation of the border between Iraq and Kuwait and the return of Kuwaiti property .
Expenditures attributable to the Boundary Demarcation Commission in providing this support during this period amounted to $ 1,214,476 and were credited to the UNIKOM Special Account as miscellaneous income .
As indicated in paragraph 18 above , there is an unencumbered balance of $ 11,304,367 gross ( $ 10,311,740 net ) for the period from 9 April 1991 to 31 October 1993 .
However , in the light of the outstanding assessed contributions of $ 33,068,098 that remain uncollected , the Secretary-General recommends that no action be taken , at this time , in connection with the unencumbered balance .
XI . ACTION TO BE TAKEN BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AT
ITS FORTY-SEVENTH SESSION
The actions to be taken by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session , in connection with the financing of UNIKOM , are as follows :
( a ) The appropriation of the amount of $ 19,800,000 gross ( $ 18,600,000 net ) authorized with the concurrence of the Advisory Committee under the terms of paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution 47 / 208 of 22 December 1992 , for the maintenance of the Observation Mission for the period from 1 May to 31 October 1993 ;
( b ) The appropriation of the amount of $ 24,616,100 gross ( $ 24,505,700 net ) and the apportionment thereof for the enlargement of UNIKOM for the period from 1 May to 31 October 1993 , inclusive of the $ 4 million authorized by the Advisory Committee ;
( c ) With regard to the period after 31 October 1993 , provision by means of appropriation and / or commitment authorization , as appropriate , of such amounts , should the Security Council decide to continue UNIKOM beyond that date ;
( d ) A decision to retain the unencumbered balance of appropriations in the Special Account for UNIKOM in the light of the outstanding assessed contributions ;
( e ) A decision that the special arrangements as regards article IV of the Financial Regulations , as referred to in paragraph 15 above , be applied to UNIKOM .

This estimate provides for payment to troop-contributing Governments of the costs of contingent-owned equipment furnished to their contingents at the request of the United Nations .
This equipment consists of 145 vehicles and other equipment and supplies .
In the political area it is essential that UNIKOM maintain liaison with the Ministries of Foreign Affairs , embassies and , in the case of Kuwait , with the Ministry of the Interior in order to keep them abreast of UNIKOM &apos;s activities and to ensure early warning of potential problematic areas .
Additionally , there is a need to ensure that UNIKOM is amply covered by media and public information agencies to promote understanding of UNIKOM &apos;s role and mandate .
To this end two additional Political Affairs Officer posts are being requested for the Liaison Offices at Kuwait and Baghdad .
Moreover , in view of the expansion of the mandate , UNIKOM requires a legal officer to handle day-to-day legal problems , assisting in implementing the host agreements as well as a number of administrative legal matters .
In relation to the expansion of dialogue and consultation with the two parties , one General Service post is being requested to serve as a backup to the Interpreter / Translator in the Office of the Chief Military Observer and another General Service staff member is needed to assist the Public Information Officer with compilation of materials and filing of documentation .
One locally-recruited clerk-typist is required to provide clerical and secretarial services to the Legal Officer and the Public Information Officer .
Additional staff are required to install , repair and maintain the new facilities at the eight mobile positions and two camps that will be deployed .
The need for 13 transport personnel ( vehicle mechanics and heavy duty drivers ) , 13 General Service skilled workers ( plumbers , carpenters , painters , etc . ) , and 12 communications personnel ( electricians , generator mechanics , radio operators , air-conditioner technicians and switchboard operators ) is based on the new deployment which will increase the number of locations requiring this expertise .
On the administrative side , the increased volume of work for the Procurement Section will require an increase in staff to ensure prompt and expeditious procurement of materials and supplies , as well as for the processing of contracts .
Moreover , the processing of battalion finances , rations and all finance-related matters will increase the workload of the Finance Section .
The workload of the Personnel Section will likewise increase owing to the increase in the recruitment of local staff .
All of these functions will require support staff to provide secretarial and administrative support .
Two General Service and four locally-recruited administrative staff posts are required for this purpose .
The breakdown of the additional posts by category and section is shown in table 1 below :

PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR THE BIENNIUM 1992-1993
THE SITUATION OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN HAITI
Eighteenth report of the Advisory Committee on
Administrative and Budgetary Questions
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the statement ( A / C.5 / 47 / 93 ) , submitted by the Secretary-General in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly , on the programme budget implications of draft resolution A / 47 / L.56 , relating to the situation of democracy and human rights in Haiti .
The Advisory Committee recalls that , following the adoption on 24 November 1992 of General Assembly resolution 47 / 20 , in which , inter alia , the Assembly requested the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures in order to assist , in cooperation with the Organization of American States ( OAS ) , in the solution of the Haitian crisis , the Secretary-General had appointed a special envoy for Haiti and had dispatched an advance team , a survey group and human rights experts to that country .
For the financing of those requirements , the Committee had authorized the Secretary-General to enter into commitments of up to $ 1 million ; that amount has now been incorporated into the budget estimates submitted in the Secretary-General &apos;s statement under consideration .
Pursuant to the request contained in paragraph 10 of General Assembly resolution 47 / 20 , the Secretary-General submitted a report ( A / 47 / 908 ) , inter alia , recommending that the General Assembly establish the United Nations component of a United Nations / OAS joint International Civilian Mission in Haiti .
That report also forms the basis for the preparation of the budget estimates submitted for consideration .
93-22151 ( E ) 160493 / ...
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 5 of the Secretary-General &apos;s statement that the mission in Haiti would include a United Nations and an OAS contingent of observers of equal strength .
From paragraph 11 the Committee notes that discussions are continuing between the two organizations on sharing the costs of the human and material resources required to enable the international staff in both components to carry out their functions , with regard to recruitment , accommodation , transportation and communications .
Although it is the Secretary-General &apos;s view that , given the joint nature of the mission , those costs should be equally shared between the two organizations , the Committee was informed , on inquiry , that agreement is being worked out on the subject .
As set out in paragraph 7 of the statement , the proposed staffing for the United Nations component of the mission includes one post at the Under-Secretary-General level for the Special Envoy and one post at the Assistant Secretary-General level for the Executive Director , the related costs to be shared by the United Nations and OAS .
The Advisory Committee was informed that formal agreement is also being worked out in this regard .
The Committee notes that provision has been made by the United Nations for 196 international staff , including 133 human rights observers .
With regard to the other 63 staff , including 7 human rights coordinators , who would be performing administrative and supervisory functions for the joint mission , the Committee could not be provided , at this stage , with an indication as to the source of funding .
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 8 of the statement that options for possible transfer of surplus equipment from existing missions are currently under review .
However , since such equipment has not yet been identified , no allowance has been made for such transfers .
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 13 of the statement that the Secretary-General has established a Trust Fund for Haiti and intends to solicit voluntary contributions to help meet costs related to this effort .
Estimated requirements at full cost for the mission for 1993 are given in paragraph 10 of the statement , and in annex III to the statement .
However , as indicated in paragraph 11 , the actual cost to the United Nations is likely to be less than the figures indicated ; but their exact amount cannot be estimated until a formula has been agreed with OAS on the modalities for sharing them between the two organizations .
At this stage therefore the Secretary-General is requesting only an appropriation of $ 19,112,600 net , which is expected to cover the full cost of the international staff of the United Nations component plus 35 per cent of the estimated cost of the local support personnel and goods and services required for the joint mission .
As indicated in paragraph 12 of the statement , the Secretary-General will report further on requirements when the discussions with OAS have been concluded and request such additional appropriations or commitment authority as required .
The Advisory Committee has been informed that a report will be submitted in September pursuant to operative paragraph 9 of draft resolution A / 47 / L.56 and taking into account the Secretary-General &apos;s statement ( A / 47 / 908 , para . 95 ) that it is important that a comprehensive review of the operational plan take place not later than September 1993 so that it can be revised in the light of experience .
Under the circumstances , and pending submission of a comprehensive report by the Secretary-General in September , the Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform the General Assembly that , should the Assembly adopt draft resolution A / 47 / L.56 , there will be need for an expenditure of up to $ 19,112,600 under the objects of expenditure outlined in paragraph 10 of the Secretary-General &apos;s statement .
The representatives of the Secretary-General informed the Advisory Committee that assessment of the relevant amounts is not necessary at this stage .
That being the case , and in view of the report to be submitted by the Secretary-General in September 1993 ( see paras . 9 and 10 above ) , the Committee believes that the Secretary-General should be authorized to enter into further commitments of up to $ 18.1 million ( commitment authority of $ 1 million already exists : see para . 2 above ) .
Such amounts as may be necessary can be appropriated and assessed on the basis of the proposals contained in the Secretary-General &apos;s report in September 1993 , which would indicate , inter alia , the results of the negotiations with OAS on cost sharing , the performance of the mission to date and the status of the voluntary contributions to the Trust Fund .
In this connection , the Committee trusts that the Secretary-General will intensify efforts to collect voluntary contributions , which will also help to ensure the necessary cash flow .

I. INTRODUCTION
1 . By its resolution 717 ( 1991 ) of 16 October 1991 , the Security Council decided to establish , under its authority , a United Nations Advance Mission in Cambodia ( UNAMIC ) immediately after the signing of the Agreements on a Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict ( hereinafter referred to as the Paris Agreements ) .
2 . UNAMIC became operational on 9 November 1991 and its mandate was expanded by the Security Council in its resolution 728 ( 1992 ) of 8 January 1992 to include training in mine clearance and the initiation of a mine-clearance programme .
3 . By its resolution 745 ( 1992 ) of 28 February 1992 , the Security Council decided to establish the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia ( UNTAC ) under its authority for a period not to exceed 18 months .
4 . The arrival in Phnom Penh on 15 March 1992 of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General marked the initial deployment of UNTAC , which thereupon absorbed UNAMIC .
5 . By paragraph 10 of its resolution 745 ( 1992 ) , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to report to it at stated intervals on progress made in the implementation of the resolution and on tasks still to be performed in the operation , with particular regard to the most effective and efficient use of resources .
In accordance with that provision , the Secretary-General submitted progress reports on 1 May 1992 , 1 / 21 September 1992 , 2 / 25 January 1993 3 / and 3 May 1993 . 4 /
6 . In the light of developments in Cambodia , the Secretary-General also submitted special reports on 12 June 1992 5 / and 14 July 1992 . 6 /
7 . In subsequent resolutions of the Security Council ( resolutions 783 ( 1992 ) of 13 October 1992 and 792 ( 1992 ) of 30 November 1992 ) , the Secretary-General was requested , inter alia , to report to the Council on the implementation of those resolutions and on any further measures that might be necessary and appropriate to ensure the realization of the fundamental objectives of the Paris Agreements .
Pursuant to those requests , the Secretary-General submitted reports to the Security Council on 15 November 1992 7 / and 13 February 1993 8 / which were endorsed and approved by the Council in its resolutions 792 ( 1992 ) of 30 November 1992 and 810 ( 1993 ) of 8 March 1993 , respectively .
8 . In paragraph 18 of its resolution 792 ( 1992 ) , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to consider the implications for the electoral process of the failure of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea ( PDK ) to canton and demobilize its forces and , in response to that situation , to take all appropriate steps to ensure the successful implementation of the electoral process .
9 . In paragraph 19 of that resolution , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to investigate and report upon the implications for security in post-election Cambodia of the possible incomplete implementation of the disarmament and demobilization provisions of the Paris Agreements .
10 . By its resolution 810 ( 1993 ) , the Security Council endorsed the decision by the Supreme National Council that the election for the constituent assembly would be held from 23 to 27 May 1993 .
11 . In paragraph 6 of that resolution , the Security Council called on UNTAC to continue to make every effort to create and maintain a neutral political environment conducive to the holding of free and fair elections , and requested the Secretary-General to inform the Council by 15 May 1993 of the conditions and preparations for the elections .
Pursuant to that request , the Secretary-General submitted a report to the Council on 15 May 1993 , 9 / which was approved by the Council in its resolution 826 ( 1993 ) of 20 May 1993 .
12 . In paragraph 10 of its resolution 826 ( 1993 ) , the Security Council called on UNTAC to continue to work in accordance with resolution 810 ( 1993 ) to ensure a neutral political environment conducive to the holding of free and fair elections .
13 . In paragraph 16 of that resolution , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to report promptly to it on the holding and results of the election , including on the conduct of the parties regarding their obligations under the Paris Agreements and , if necessary , to recommend any initiative and / or measures conducive to ensuring their full respect by all parties .
14 . By paragraph 2 of its resolution 835 ( 1993 ) of 2 June 1993 , the Security Council invited the Secretary-General to make his report on the elections available as soon as possible .
16 . By its resolution 840 ( 1993 ) , the Security Council endorsed the results of the election , which had been certified free and fair by the United Nations .
17 . In paragraph 7 of that resolution , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to report to it by the middle of July , including on his recommendations on the possible role the United Nations and its agencies might play after the end of the mandate of UNTAC according to the Paris Agreements .
18 . It is recalled that , by its resolution 47 / 209 of 22 December 1992 , the General Assembly decided to appropriate , in accordance with the recommendation contained in paragraph 62 of the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions ( A / 47 / 763 ) , an amount of $ 483,961,200 gross ( $ 470,808,500 net ) for the continued operation of UNTAC for the period from 1 November 1992 to 30 April 1993 . This was in addition to the amount of $ 839,576,200 gross ( $ 833,171,300 net ) already appropriated for UNAMIC and UNTAC .
19 . By its resolution 47 / 209 , the General Assembly decided that the unencumbered balance of $ 162,345,800 gross ( $ 160,941,000 net ) in respect of the period from 1 November 1991 to 31 October 1992 would be set off against the apportionment among Member States .
20 . In paragraph 7 of that resolution , the General Assembly authorized the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for the operations of UNTAC at a rate not to exceed $ 241,841,300 gross ( $ 235,823,600 net ) for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993 , subject to obtaining the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee .
21 . In a letter dated 13 April 1993 to the Chairman of the Advisory Committee , the Controller indicated that the full commitment authorization for the three-month period from 1 May to 31 July 1993 provided for under General Assembly resolution 47 / 209 would be required , in addition to the unencumbered balance remaining from the appropriations provided for UNTAC .
The concurrence of the Advisory Committee was therefore sought in the amount of $ 241,841,300 gross ( $ 235,823,600 net ) , together with the unencumbered balance of appropriations of $ 6,606,700 gross ( $ 3,297,600 net ) for the continued operation of UNTAC through 31 July 1993 .
22 . In a letter dated 13 April 1993 , the Chairman of the Advisory Committee informed the Secretary-General that the Committee concurred in the request to enter into commitments in an amount not exceeding $ 236 million gross for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993 .
23 . In paragraph 12 of its resolution 47 / 209 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit to it at its forty-eighth session a detailed performance report on the budget of UNTAC , including the planned disposal of the assets of the operation .
The present report is submitted to the Assembly at its forty-seventh session rather than its forty-eighth session , as requested , in order to make appropriate provision for the additional requirements of UNTAC for the period from 1 May to 31 July 1993 , and for the one-month period beyond 31 July 1993 .
Appropriate provision would also be required for the costs associated with the liquidation phase of the UNTAC operation .
24 . Progress achieved by each component of UNTAC , as detailed in the third 3 / and fourth 4 / progress reports of the Secretary-General to the Security Council , is summarized below .
A. Progress achieved by each component
1 . Human rights component
25 . In pursuance of its basic mandate , UNTAC continued to expand its human rights education and training programmes both in Phnom Penh and in the provinces , with particular reference to teacher training , dissemination of relevant international instruments , education of health professionals , training of public and political officials and support for local human rights organizations .
2 . Electoral component
26 . Registration of voters , which began in October 1992 , was completed on 31 January 1993 .
The number of registered voters reached nearly 4.7 million , or some 96 per cent of the estimated eligible population .
On the basis of the number of registered voters , 120 seats for the Constituent Assembly had been allocated to the 21 provinces and the Phnom Penh special district .
27 . A total of 20 out of the 22 provisionally registered political parties had applied for official party registration in accordance with the Electoral Law .
28 . Polling stations were divided into large , medium or small static stations - consisting of eight , six and three polling teams respectively - as well as mobile stations .
It was planned that each polling station would have a Cambodian Presiding Officer in charge and one International Polling Station Officer to provide support and assist the Presiding Officer .
Approximately 1,000 international polling station officers from more than 30 countries would be recruited .
3 . Military component
29 . The refusal of PDK to participate in the cantonment and demobilization process had made it necessary to adjust the deployment of the military component , with a view to enhancing the ability of UNTAC to protect voter registration and , subsequently , the electoral and polling processes , particularly in remote or insecure areas .
In order to accomplish this , the deployment pattern of the military component had been realigned to conform with the deployment of electoral teams and shorten the time taken to respond to potential threats to them .
The new deployment was completed on 31 December 1992 .
31 . As a result of attacks on UNTAC military and civilian personnel , all units of the military component in all locations were directed to enhance their security measures and procedures .
The defensive positions of the military component were expanded to allow the construction of bunkers and overhead protection as well as firing bays .
Permanent guards and / or mobile patrols were used to improve the physical security of premises where UNTAC assets are located in isolated locations .
Security at UNTAC headquarters had also been strengthened by heightening the walls around the compound and by improving the illumination along the walls .
32 . The five engineering units of UNTAC , supplemented by the engineer platoons in 11 of the 12 infantry battalions , have repaired hundreds of bridges and improved scores of kilometres of roads , as well as airfields at Pochentong ( Phnom Penh ) and Stung Treng .
33 . In the past year , the Mine Clearance Training Unit was instrumental in clearing more than 1.6 million square metres of land and disposing of more than 15,000 mines and other pieces of unexploded ordnance .
4 . Civil administration component
34 . Progress had been achieved in the further development of the expenditure control procedure , the establishment of a border control mechanism , the planning of specialized control operations in telecommunications and civil aviation and the measures taken to promote a neutral political environment .
As the election approached , emphasis was placed on preventing the use of personnel and premises of local authorities for partisan political purposes .
5 . Civilian police component
35 . Much of the daily work of the civilian police component had been focused on the supervision or control of local police activities .
During the period , UNTAC civilian police provided basic police training for the three Cambodian factions cooperating with UNTAC .
In addition , the component undertook a comprehensive study of the size , organization and equipment of the police forces of the three cooperating factions .
36 . UNTAC civilian police had also been closely involved with other activities relating to the establishment and maintenance of acceptable conditions for the conduct of free and fair elections and to contribute to security arrangements for the election .
6 . Repatriation component
37 . The repatriation of some 360,000 refugees and displaced persons was completed by 30 April 1993 .
All eligible Cambodian refugees and displaced persons were given the opportunity to be registered for elections on their return to their homeland .
7 . Rehabilitation component
38 . The rehabilitation component , in close coordination with UNTAC military observers , civil administration and civilian police personnel deployed at border checkpoints , continued to monitor the extent of compliance with the moratorium on the export of timber adopted by the Supreme National Council on 22 September 1992 .
39 . In addition to the total of 35 rehabilitation projects worth $ 340 million approved in 1992 , the Supreme National Council approved a further 10 projects worth about $ 26 million .
However , by March 1993 only about $ 100 million of the $ 880 million pledged at the Ministerial Conference on the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Cambodia held at Tokyo in June 1992 had been disbursed .
B. Implementation of Security Council resolutions
1 . Implementation of Security Council resolution 792 ( 1992 )
41 . In view of the increasing acts of political and ethnic violence , in addition to measures described in paragraphs 29 to 31 above , the civilian police and military components of UNTAC instituted intensive patrols and static guard duty to improve the security of political party offices .
42 . In order to foster a neutral political environment conducive to the holding of free and fair elections , UNTAC announced that it would give priority to protecting three freedoms , namely , freedom from intimidation , freedom of party affiliation and freedom of action for political parties .
43 . By paragraphs 10 , 12 , 13 and 14 of its resolution 792 ( 1992 ) , the Security Council adopted a number of measures concerning border control and the protection of the natural resources of Cambodia .
In accordance with those provisions , UNTAC appealed to neighbouring countries to assist in the implementation of the moratorium on the export of timber .
UNTAC also deployed border control teams to monitor closely any violations of the moratorium by land or sea .
44 . In the broader context of border control , civil administration staff of UNTAC had been deployed to monitor other areas such as customs and immigration control .
